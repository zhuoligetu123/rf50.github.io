00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.279
The examples that we investigated in

00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:05.684
discretes or combinatorial planning were quite simple.

00:00:05.684 --> 00:00:08.894
They were two-dimensional examples of limited size.

00:00:08.894 --> 00:00:11.503
There are times when you can simplify your environment

00:00:11.503 --> 00:00:14.324
and robot to a two-dimensional representation.

00:00:14.324 --> 00:00:18.019
For instance, a vacuum robot traversing somebody's house.

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:22.850
In such a case, there isn't a need for a complex three-dimensional representation,

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.580
as a little robot can't do anything more than

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.389
translate and rotate on the 2D plane that is the floor.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.689
But there will also be times when you find yourself limited by

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.254
the two-dimensional representation and will need to work in a three-dimensional world,

00:00:37.255 --> 00:00:40.580
with robots that have six degrees of freedom or more.

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.479
Such a scenario is a lot more challenging to perform path planning in.

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:48.654
It may be possible to apply the algorithms that you learned in the previous lesson,

00:00:48.655 --> 00:00:53.030
however, the efficiency of these algorithms becomes more and more critical.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.870
Performing a complete discretization of the entire space and

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:00.984
applying a graph search algorithm to the space may be too costly.

00:01:00.984 --> 00:01:05.569
To tackle the path planning problems of larger size and greater dimension,

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:08.090
there exists alternate algorithms that fall under

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.850
the umbrella of sample-based path planning.

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:15.469
Instead of conducting a complete discretization of the configuration space,

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:18.769
these algorithms randomly sample the space hoping that

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:23.259
the collection of samples will adequately represent the configuration space.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.859
Sample based path planning is the first topic that you'll learn in this lesson.

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:30.650
The second is probabilistic path planning,

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.200
which we'll look at how we can explicitly consider

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.120
the uncertainty of robot motion when planning paths.
