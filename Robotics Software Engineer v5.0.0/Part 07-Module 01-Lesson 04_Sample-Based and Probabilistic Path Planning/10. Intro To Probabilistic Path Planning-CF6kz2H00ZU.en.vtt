00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
The remainder of this lesson will focus on probabilistic path planning.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.504
Recall the exploratory rover introduced at the start of the previous lesson.

00:00:08.505 --> 00:00:10.770
It's task was to find a path from

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.410
its drop-off location to the goal location that would be safe for humans to follow.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.254
The terrain contains a lot of different hazards.

00:00:18.254 --> 00:00:22.245
The operator of the rover is willing to take whatever risk is necessary,

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:25.515
but would naturally want to minimize it as much as possible.

00:00:25.515 --> 00:00:30.585
The algorithms that you have learned thus far are unable to adequately model the risk.

00:00:30.585 --> 00:00:34.215
For instance, a combinatorial path planning algorithm

00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:38.285
would have no difficulty finding this path to the goal location.

00:00:38.284 --> 00:00:41.238
The path may be the best by all other means,

00:00:41.238 --> 00:00:43.699
but due to the uncertainty of the rover motion,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.540
there is a chance that the rover will meet its demise along this path.

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:49.789
It is possible to inflate the size of

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.104
the rover to ensure that there is enough room to maneuver.

00:00:53.104 --> 00:00:54.644
But as you have seen,

00:00:54.645 --> 00:00:57.234
the algorithm will no longer be complete.

00:00:57.234 --> 00:01:01.759
Another idea is to give negative rewards to dangerous areas of

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:06.394
the map so that the search algorithm is more likely to select alternate paths.

00:01:06.394 --> 00:01:09.274
Similar to what you did in reinforcement learning,

00:01:09.275 --> 00:01:11.510
this is a step in the right direction,

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.594
and would cause the rover to avoid dangerous areas.

00:01:14.594 --> 00:01:18.439
But it does not actually considered the uncertainty of the rover motion.

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.469
What we'd really like is to model the uncertainty

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.590
by considering a non-deterministic transition model.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.795
For instance, the following one.

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:29.465
Since path execution is uncertain,

00:01:29.465 --> 00:01:32.210
an algorithm that takes the uncertainty into account

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:35.929
explicitly is more likely to produce realistic paths.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.685
So, where does that leave us?

00:01:37.685 --> 00:01:40.415
We're back to Markov decision processes.

00:01:40.415 --> 00:01:42.185
In the remainder of this lesson,

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:44.780
you will learn probabilistic path planning using

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.000
Markov decision processes and add one additional algorithm to your repertoire.
