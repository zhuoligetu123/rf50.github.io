00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.275
Congratulations. You've come to the conclusion of ROS essentials.

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:06.315
After the understanding of ROS,

00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:08.835
you are now prepared for the projects to come.

00:00:08.835 --> 00:00:13.695
While we hope you now have a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts of ROS,

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:17.160
the lessons here are by no means comprehensive.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.344
Fortunately, there are a wealth of resources available online.

00:00:21.344 --> 00:00:24.104
First and foremost, is the ROS wiki.

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:29.414
The ROS wiki is the primary source of documentation for all official ROS packages.

00:00:29.414 --> 00:00:33.869
Additionally, the ROS wiki hosts many helpful tutorials.

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:35.929
Aside from a simple web search,

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:40.284
this is probably the first place you should go if you are having a ROS related problem.

00:00:40.284 --> 00:00:43.099
If the wiki does not provide the answers you need,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.590
ROS answers is the next best bet.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.710
With tens of thousands of questions and answers,

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.750
there's a good chance that somebody has

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.335
already solved the problem that you are dealing with.

00:00:53.335 --> 00:00:56.840
We hope you're excited to keep building robots with ROS.
