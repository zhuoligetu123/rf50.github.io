00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.054
Over the course of this Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree program,

00:00:05.054 --> 00:00:07.589
you will build five projects.

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.675
Each project will demonstrate the skills you learned in the preceding lessons.

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:18.750
These five projects will constitute a great portfolio for potential employers.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.170
We will kick off the program by prototyping robots in a simulator called Gazebo.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.240
In the Build My Word project,

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.659
you will work with Gazebo to simulate an environment,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.659
comprise of a building to house your future robot.

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:40.084
Next, you will learn the robot operating system or ROS for short.

00:00:40.085 --> 00:00:42.109
In the Go Chase It project,

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:46.129
you will use rows to design and build a mobile robot.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.630
You will house you knew robot in the world you built in the first project.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:56.185
Eventually, you will program your robot to chase a ball through this world.

00:00:56.185 --> 00:01:00.609
Both the world that you create in the first project and robotic design in

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:06.930
this project will form the base for all your upcoming projects in this program.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.404
After studying ROS and Gazebo,

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:14.479
you will learn to manage uncertainty with probabilistic algorithms.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.219
In the third module,

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:19.579
you will learn probabilistic localization algorithms to estimate

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.650
the robot's position and orientation. In the Where Am I?

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.700
project you will develop an autonomous driving system to localize the robot.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.795
First, you will navigate your robot through a series of waypoints.

00:01:32.795 --> 00:01:37.480
Then you will localize it with the localization package in ROS.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.120
After that, you will study mapping algorithms.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.250
By combining mapping with the skills you learnt within the previous lessons,

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.344
you will be able to implement simultaneous localization and mapping, or SLAM.

00:01:52.344 --> 00:01:55.019
In the Map My World Robot project,

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:56.685
you would use SLAM package,

00:01:56.685 --> 00:02:04.025
with ROS to simultaneously localize your robot and create 2D and 3D maps of your world.

00:02:04.025 --> 00:02:09.860
Finally, you will learn how to search for a path and navigate it with classical,

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.205
sample-based, and probabilistic algorithms.

00:02:13.205 --> 00:02:15.545
In the Home Service Robot project,

00:02:15.544 --> 00:02:19.639
you will integrate everything you learnt in this Nanodegree program to build

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:26.375
a home service robot that will navigate to pick up and deliver objects inside your world.

00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:29.750
There is a lot to learn and it will be a challenge.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.604
But once you've completed this Nanodegree program you'd have developed

00:02:33.604 --> 00:02:37.759
an impressive set of robotic skills and build amazing projects.
