00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
I became roboticist in the very beginning of

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.555
my studies because I cared about artificial intelligence.

00:00:06.555 --> 00:00:08.385
But rather than selling in vacuum,

00:00:08.385 --> 00:00:10.740
I wanted to build something that moves.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.105
So, when you code and write a program,

00:00:13.105 --> 00:00:16.395
you could actually honestly see what will happen in the physical world.

00:00:16.395 --> 00:00:20.580
Students should be excited about this program because they'll get a chance to master

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.305
robotic skills while working through the projects and taking our lessons.

00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:30.660
These skills are essential for them to pursue a career in Robotics Software Engineering.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.009
So, in my head,

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.315
robot is like a big term but really it's about sensing the world.

00:00:36.315 --> 00:00:41.400
Then, thinking about it and deciding what action to take and I'm taking action,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.575
an action affecting the world in some way.

00:00:43.575 --> 00:00:45.030
Now, robotic is pervasive.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.530
We have robots in space,

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.750
in toys, in your home,

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.030
and things that don't even look like robots,

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.165
like your entire house are becoming robotized.

00:00:54.165 --> 00:00:55.850
Go through a modern surgery room in

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.150
a hospital and you find robots assisting surgeons through surgery.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.065
After graduating from our Robotics Software Engineer in nanodegree program,

00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:07.595
you'll get a chance to pursue careers in various fields such as health care,

00:01:07.595 --> 00:01:11.255
self-driving cars, drones, and so much more.

00:01:11.255 --> 00:01:16.435
The future of robotics is going in a direction about helping people, helping society.

00:01:16.435 --> 00:01:17.960
I can tell you there's a huge shortage of

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.765
roboticists and this field is growing very massively.

00:01:20.765 --> 00:01:23.825
You don't have to feel like you have to be able to do everything.

00:01:23.825 --> 00:01:27.620
You can actually become mechanical engineering expert in

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.195
a robotics project or computer science expert in a robotics project.

00:01:32.195 --> 00:01:33.580
So, from that point of view,

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.735
the field is big but you can be almost anyone to contribute to the society.

00:01:38.735 --> 00:01:40.385
As a student in our program,

00:01:40.385 --> 00:01:42.640
you'll get a chance to build five different projects.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.560
You will put together everything you learn in

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.575
this program to simulate a home service robot,

00:01:47.575 --> 00:01:51.115
which will transport objects from one room to another.

00:01:51.115 --> 00:01:55.760
You can build upon this project to make it to your day to day home service robot.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.670
With all these projects that you build in this program,

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.190
you'll have a great portfolio to show your employer.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.000
At Udacity, we build nanodegree programs like this one to

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.925
find your job and we work with leading industry partners,

00:02:06.925 --> 00:02:11.130
to really build curriculum that empowers you to get a job in those industries,

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.590
and more importantly, you learn stuff you wouldn't expect you'd be learning. Have fun.
