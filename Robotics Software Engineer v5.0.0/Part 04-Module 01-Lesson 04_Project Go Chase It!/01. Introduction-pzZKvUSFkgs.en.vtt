00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.770
Welcome to Go Chase It.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.984
In this project, you will build a bold chaser mobile robot with ROS.

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:08.820
The project is divided into two major tasks.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.464
First, design the robot and house it inside your world.

00:00:12.464 --> 00:00:16.829
Second, program it to chase white colored balls through the word.

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.169
In the first task, you will learn how to model

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.929
a mobile robot that can interface with ROS.

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.640
You will use what you learned in this module to design and customize the robot.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.394
Then, house the inside the environment you created in the, Build my world project.

00:00:30.394 --> 00:00:33.875
In the second task, you will write to ROS nodes.

00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:38.480
The first node, drive bot will provide a service to drive the robot.

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:43.084
The second node, process image will subscribe to the robots camera images,

00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:44.570
search for a wide bot,

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.439
then if it exists, identify its position and requests a service

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:52.609
from your first node to drive the robot toward the white colored ball.

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.850
This is a fun project that demonstrates your ability to work with

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.160
ROS nodes and services. Let's dive in.
