00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
One of the simplest types of search is called breadth-first search,

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.179
or BFS for short.

00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:12.149
It has its name because the algorithm searches a space broadly before it searches deeply.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.160
Let's look at a search tree.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.780
Here, we have a number of

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.919
interconnected nodes with the start node at the top of the tree.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.020
Breadth-first search traverses the tree exploring at one level at a time.

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.169
It will traverse all the nodes at this level,

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.840
the children nodes, before it moves on to traverse the grandchildren nodes and so-forth.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.075
How the algorithm breaks ties changes from implementation to implementation.

00:00:39.075 --> 00:00:41.065
But on a search tree like this,

00:00:41.064 --> 00:00:44.299
it is usually implied that you move left to right.

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:47.759
So, after a few steps of searching through this tree,

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:50.420
the nodes would have been searched in this order,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.335
starting with node number one at the top of the tree.

00:00:53.335 --> 00:00:55.380
If you were to continue searching,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.620
can you identify on which steps

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:02.369
the search algorithm would reach the nodes labeled A, B, and C?
