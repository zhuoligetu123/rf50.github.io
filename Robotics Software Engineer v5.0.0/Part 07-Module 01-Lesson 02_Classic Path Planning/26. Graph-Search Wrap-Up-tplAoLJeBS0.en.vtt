00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
Awesome. You've learned some very applicable search algorithms

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.105
for path planning in a discretized space.

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:08.700
Using this knowledge, you'll be able to direct

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:11.910
your robot to get from one point on a map to another.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.224
Hopefully, prove itself useful in one way or another.

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:19.035
The search algorithms are also relevant in many other fields,

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:23.714
from planning routes for your next drive to finding your friends on social media sites.

00:00:23.714 --> 00:00:27.434
Graph search is widely used in today's digital society.

00:00:27.434 --> 00:00:30.103
In addition to learning the algorithms themselves,

00:00:30.103 --> 00:00:32.670
you've also learned some essential vocabulary.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.700
You should now be able to assess an algorithms completeness,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.080
optimality, efficiency, and other qualities.
