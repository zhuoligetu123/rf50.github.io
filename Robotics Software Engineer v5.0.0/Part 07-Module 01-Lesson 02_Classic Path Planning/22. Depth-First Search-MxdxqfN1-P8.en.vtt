00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.299
Depth-first search, or DFS for short,

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:05.699
is another uninformed search algorithm.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.470
Like the name suggests,

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:11.489
depth-first search searches deep before it searches broadly.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.410
If we go back to our search tree,

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.984
you can see this in action.

00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:19.589
Instead of commencing at the top node and searching level by level,

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:23.910
DFS will explore the start nodes first child and then that nodes

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.980
first child and so on until it hits the lowest leaf in this branch.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.250
Only then will DFS backup to a node which had

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.865
more than one child and explore this node second child.

00:00:35.865 --> 00:00:38.910
After a few steps of searching through the tree,

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:41.129
the nodes would have been searched in this order,

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.960
once again, starting with node number one at the top of the tree.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.980
If you were to continue searching with a depth-first search algorithm,

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:52.069
can you identify on which steps the search algorithm would

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.189
reach the nodes labeled A, B, and C?
