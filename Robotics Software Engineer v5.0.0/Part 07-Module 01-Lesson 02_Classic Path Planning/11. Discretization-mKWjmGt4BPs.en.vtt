00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.509
To be able to apply a search algorithm,

00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:04.859
the configuration space must be reduced to

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.660
a finite size that an algorithm can traverse in a reasonable amount of time,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.035
as a searches for a path from the start to the goal.

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:17.210
This reduction in size can be accomplished by discretization.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.740
Discretization is the process of breaking down a continuous entity,

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:25.464
in this case a configuration space into discrete segments.

00:00:25.464 --> 00:00:29.809
There are different methods that can be applied to discretize a continuous space.

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:31.549
In the next few concepts,

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.090
you will learn about three different methods of discretization.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.025
They are called roadmap,

00:00:37.024 --> 00:00:39.814
cell decomposition, and gradient fields.

00:00:39.814 --> 00:00:42.994
Each has its own advantages and disadvantages

00:00:42.994 --> 00:00:46.625
balancing trade-offs such as time and the level of detail.

00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:48.859
Once you're equipped with that knowledge,

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.590
you will dive into graph search which can be applied

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.640
to find a path from a start node to the goal node.
