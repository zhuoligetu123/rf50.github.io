00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
Great. We're on to the last step of discreet planning, graph search.

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.439
Graph search is used to find a finite sequence of

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.460
discrete actions to connect a start state to a goal state.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.515
It does so by searching.

00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:16.875
Visiting states sequentially asking every state,

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:19.379
"Hey, are you the goal state?"

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:23.910
As a human, you may find it easy to pick out a solution to search problem

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.920
when the search problem is two-dimensional and

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.725
manageable in size. For instance, this one.

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:32.399
However, a computer must conduct the search manually.

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.310
It goes through node by node and doesn't see

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.200
the goal node until it is one node away, like so.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.880
As the size of the space grows and dimensions are added,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.725
the problem naturally becomes less trivial.

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:48.950
It becomes imperative to choose the appropriate algorithm

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.554
for the task to achieve satisfactory results.

00:00:52.554 --> 00:00:56.990
There are two different types of search algorithms; informed and uninformed.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.450
Uninformed algorithms search blindly.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.230
They're not given any contextual information about how close they are to

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.459
the goal or how much of an effect every consequent action has.

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:09.739
Informed searches, on the other hand,

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:13.354
can guide the search algorithm to make more intelligent decisions,

00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:16.825
ideally, getting them to the goal faster.

00:01:16.825 --> 00:01:18.984
By the end of the section,

00:01:18.984 --> 00:01:22.280
you'll be able to apply several different graph search algorithms

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.689
and in the following lab,

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.620
you will have the opportunity to implement one of the algorithms in C++.
