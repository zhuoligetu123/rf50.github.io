Please see below for an explanation of what each usage means.\n\n## Term Deadline\n\nPassing a project, in this context, means that a Udacity Reviewer has marked your project as “Meets Specifications.” In order to complete a term, you have to pass all projects by the last day of the term.\n\nIf you do not pass all projects by the last day of the term, the following happens:\n\n* You will receive a 4-week extension to complete any outstanding projects. You will receive this extension a maximum of one time. Once you submit and pass all projects, you can enroll in the next term, which will potentially be with a later class. If you do not submit and pass all projects within the 4-week extension, you will be removed from the program.\n\n\n## Suggested Project Due Dates",
