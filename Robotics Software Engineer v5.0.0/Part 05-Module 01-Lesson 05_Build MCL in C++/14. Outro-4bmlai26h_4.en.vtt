00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.424
Congratulations. You've just coded MCL in C++.

00:00:04.424 --> 00:00:07.980
Now you can upload this code to any real world mobile robot with

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.790
rangefinder sensors to estimate its pose any node map.

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:16.304
You've probably noticed that the average error changes every time you run the program.

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:19.800
This is because MCL is a probabilistic estimation.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.765
Now share with your classmates,

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:25.109
the number of steps it took you to achieve a converging solution.

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.849
In the upcoming project,

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.470
you'll use ROS and implement the Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization package.

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:35.070
Don't worry, I know that you're not familiar with AMCL yet,

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.990
but stay tuned to learn it.
