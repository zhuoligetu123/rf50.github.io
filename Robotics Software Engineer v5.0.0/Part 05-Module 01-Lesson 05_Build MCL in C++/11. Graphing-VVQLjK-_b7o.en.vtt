00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.889
So far, you've coded MCL and evaluated the overall quality of your solution.

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:08.804
Now, you will be able to visualize what you have coded,

00:00:08.804 --> 00:00:10.984
or more precisely, MCL in action.

00:00:10.984 --> 00:00:13.080
To do so, I am providing you with

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.725
the visualization function which takes the number of particles,

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:21.875
the robot's pose, and particles at each time step as arguments.

00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:28.129
Note that the plotting functions used here are linked to the Python matplotlib library.

00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:31.199
Initially, I am formatting the graph by including

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.630
a title and specifying the x and y limits.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.850
Then, I am plotting the original particles with green circles,

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.064
and the re-sampled particles with yellow circles.

00:00:43.064 --> 00:00:47.954
Following, I am plotting the eight fixed landmarks with red circles.

00:00:47.954 --> 00:00:51.479
Moving on, I am plotting the robot position which

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:55.625
is our main point of interest with a blue circle.

00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:58.905
Finally, I'm saving the plot and destroying it.

00:00:58.905 --> 00:01:03.135
Unfortunately, you will not be able to run this program in the classroom yet.

00:01:03.134 --> 00:01:07.000
So, follow the instructions and then edit and run the code.
