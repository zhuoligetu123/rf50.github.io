00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
Now, I will show you how I will manually command

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.044
my robot to reach two distinct positions with ROS navigation stack.

00:00:08.044 --> 00:00:12.370
I will open a terminal and launch my script.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.285
Now that both Gazebo and rviz are open,

00:00:27.285 --> 00:00:33.219
I can use the 2D in F goal to ask my robot to reach this first position.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.770
You can see how my robot is being localized with the AMCL package.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.255
Now, I will ask my robot to go to a second position.

00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:05.850
Let's say this one over here.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.880
The robot starts rotating and then traveling towards it.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.855
Voila! The robot successfully reached

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:34.420
two distinct position and oriented itself with respect to them.
