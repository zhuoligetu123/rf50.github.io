00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
Welcome to the final project of

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.445
the Udacity Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree Program.

00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:08.505
Throughout this journey, you localize robots,

00:00:08.505 --> 00:00:13.035
map environments, and plan trajectories for robots to navigate in.

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:16.670
Now, you will group these localization, slab,

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.840
and start planning robotic algorithms into a home service robot.

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:25.410
The goal of this project is to program a robot that can autonomously map and

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.074
environment and navigate to pick up and dropped virtual objects.

00:00:30.074 --> 00:00:33.089
This project will mainly test your abilities

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.900
and skills in setting the correct parameters,

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.228
communicating between different nodes of different packages,

00:00:39.228 --> 00:00:41.420
coding nodes B-C Plus Plus,

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.015
publishing and subscribing to different topics,

00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:46.814
writing launch files, and many others.

00:00:46.814 --> 00:00:52.699
The home service robot project is composed of multiple steps: First,

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.015
you will learn the building editor in Gazebo,

00:00:55.015 --> 00:00:57.560
which is a user-friendly tool that enables you to

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.039
professionally model real-world environments in simulation.

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.619
Then, you will interface slab with

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:07.019
a wall follower node to autonomously map and environment.

00:01:07.019 --> 00:01:08.545
After building the map,

00:01:08.545 --> 00:01:12.049
you will test your robot abilities in reaching multiple goals and

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.620
orient itself with respect to them using the Ross navigation stack.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.250
Finally, you will model virtual objects

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.534
with markers and learn how to deploy them with Ross.

00:01:22.534 --> 00:01:27.034
I will be walking you through the different steps in this project and in the end,

00:01:27.034 --> 00:01:31.204
expect you to put everything together to build the home service robot.

00:01:31.204 --> 00:01:35.719
Hopefully, you will later build upon this project to deploy such a robot in

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:38.179
your house and make it your day-to-day servicing

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.020
robot that can deliver anything you need.

00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:44.079
All right now, let's get started.
