00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
These diagrams of nodes, and topics,

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.109
and their connections are frequently referred to as compute graph.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.845
Visualizing the compute graph is useful for understanding

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:14.550
what nodes exist and how they communicate with one another.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.210
ROS provides a tool called RQT graph for showing the compute graph of a system.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.490
A modern complex robot will likely have dozens of

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:27.449
nodes even more topics and quite a few services.

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.250
This is an example of a mobile base demonstration platform.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.965
As far as robotics platforms go,

00:00:33.965 --> 00:00:35.850
this one is relatively simple.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.024
Primarily, consisting of a lighter unit,

00:00:39.024 --> 00:00:43.804
a depth camera and four independently driven omnidirectional wheels.

00:00:43.804 --> 00:00:46.594
Here's the robots compute graph.

00:00:46.594 --> 00:00:50.329
An RQT graph allows you to zoom in and pan

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.814
around the graph as well as choose exactly what information is displayed.

00:00:54.814 --> 00:00:56.479
Now that you've introduced to some of

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:00.004
the fundamental components of ROS communication architecture,

00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:02.730
it's time to get some hands on experience with

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.000
the helpful little simulator called TurtleSim.
