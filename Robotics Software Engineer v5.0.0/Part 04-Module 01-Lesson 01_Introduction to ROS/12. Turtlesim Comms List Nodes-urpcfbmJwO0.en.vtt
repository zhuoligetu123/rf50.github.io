00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.394
Now, that you know how to start the Ross Master and are able to run nodes,

00:00:04.394 --> 00:00:07.769
you can begin to investigate the topics and messages

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:11.954
associated with turtlesim node and turtle teleop keynote.

00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:16.109
We'll pick up this discussion from where we left off earlier.

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.714
Meaning roscore, turtlesim node,

00:00:20.714 --> 00:00:24.179
and the turtle teleop key node are all running.

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.765
Let's investigate what's going on behind the scenes.

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:30.644
If you had just stumbled upon the system,

00:00:30.644 --> 00:00:33.960
you might be inclined to ask which nodes are running.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.219
To answer this, you should open a new terminal and use the command Ross node list.

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.820
This command will query the Ross master for a list of

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.850
all the active nodes on the system and bring them to the console. There we have it.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.465
A list of three nodes running on the system.

00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:57.125
Two of the nodes, should look relatively familiar

00:00:57.125 --> 00:01:00.770
as we explicitly lost them just a moment ago,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.495
but what's the third?

00:01:02.494 --> 00:01:07.474
Rosout, is a node that is automatically launched by the Ross Master.

00:01:07.474 --> 00:01:09.844
It's responsible for aggregating,

00:01:09.844 --> 00:01:14.730
filtering and recording log messages to a text file.
