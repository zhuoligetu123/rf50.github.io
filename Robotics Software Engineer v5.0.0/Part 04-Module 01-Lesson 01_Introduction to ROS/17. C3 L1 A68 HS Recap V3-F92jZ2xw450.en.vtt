00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.654
Great work! In this lesson,

00:00:02.654 --> 00:00:06.000
you've seen a high level overview of the concepts behind ROS.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.189
We looked at how the ROS master,

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.859
ROS's functions as a parameter server.

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:14.519
And how it enables node to be connected over topics.

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.750
Also, you've seen how ROS nodes communicate over

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.289
these topics using Message Passing and Services.

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.849
This pops up architecture is a powerful and flexible design paradigm,

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.425
that will allow you to build a variety of robotics applications.

00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:32.520
Additionally, you've explored The [inaudible] and Package.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.115
Using ROS's powerful command line tools.

00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:39.990
These tools will help you build and debug ROS based systems going forward.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.490
Next, you will learn how to build a basic cross package called "Simple Art".

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.929
For real world robotics applications,

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:49.519
you will always start by creating a new workspace,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.660
and then adding software packages to it.

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:55.169
Which is exactly what we're going to do in the next lesson.
