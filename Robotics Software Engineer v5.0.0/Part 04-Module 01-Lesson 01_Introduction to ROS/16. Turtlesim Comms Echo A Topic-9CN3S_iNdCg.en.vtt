00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.605
While message definitions and topic information can be informative,

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:08.100
sometimes the best way to understand what is going on is

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.939
to look at the messages themselves as they are published to a topic.

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:15.660
For example, when the turtle rotates left and right,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.225
which axis is it actually rotating about?

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:20.400
What are the units of rotation?

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:24.184
A rotation expressed in terms of degree or radians?

00:00:24.184 --> 00:00:26.320
To get the answer of this question,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.240
you can use the command rostopic echo.

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:31.820
Let's dive right into its usage,

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:40.000
rostopic echo, and then the name of the topic, turtle1 cmd _vel.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.859
Again, if you've forgotten the name of a topic,

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:48.350
you can easily find it by using tab completion or by using the command rostopic list,

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.495
which you were introduced to earlier.

00:00:50.494 --> 00:00:52.189
When you hit Enter,

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:55.085
the terminal cursor will move to a new line

00:00:55.085 --> 00:00:58.340
and it will appear as though nothing has happened.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.550
Fear not, rostopic echo is simply waiting

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:05.045
for a message to be published on the cmd _vel topic.

00:01:05.045 --> 00:01:07.775
In order to publish a message to the topic,

00:01:07.775 --> 00:01:13.715
we must jump all the way back to the console window for a turtle_teleop _key node.

00:01:13.715 --> 00:01:17.280
I'm going to hit the left arrow key.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.245
As expected, the turtle turned counterclockwise by some angle for about one second.

00:01:24.245 --> 00:01:28.219
I'd estimate that the actual number is greater than 90 degrees,

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:31.519
but perhaps less than 135 degrees.

00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:36.140
Let's go back to the rostopic echo terminal and see what happened.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.775
As you can see,

00:01:37.775 --> 00:01:39.215
we've got the message.

00:01:39.215 --> 00:01:42.260
All of the velocity components are zero with

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.190
the exception of the z-component of the angular velocity.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.754
Here, we see a value of two.

00:01:48.754 --> 00:01:52.399
This tell us that when the turtle rotates counterclockwise,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.260
it is doing so around the z-axis.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.520
The magnitude of the velocity tell us that the units

00:01:58.519 --> 00:02:02.164
associated with the movement are probably in radiance per second.

00:02:02.165 --> 00:02:06.890
A quick math check tells us that two radians correspond to

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.090
approximately 114.6 degrees. There we have it.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.310
You should now have some understanding about rostopic echo and

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.890
how it can be used for investigating the messages passing over a topic.

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:24.469
As a side note, the developers are for us elected

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:27.830
to standardize around SI unit whenever applicable.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.140
So length is measured in meters.

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:32.014
Mass is measured in kilograms.

00:02:32.014 --> 00:02:33.829
Time is measured in seconds.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.930
Angles are measured in radians and so on.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.835
You've now completed a brief tour of the ros command line tools.

00:02:40.835 --> 00:02:42.770
Armed with this knowledge and

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.115
a general understanding of the ROS communications architecture,

00:02:46.115 --> 00:02:48.020
you should be prepared to move on to

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.320
the next step setting out your first catkin workspace.
