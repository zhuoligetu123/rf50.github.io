00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
While perception and decision-making are

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.580
probably the most challenging pieces of robotics,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.759
the most exciting part is definitely action.

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.830
Robots can take action in many ways and for many different purposes.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.440
Like moving from one place to another,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.690
speeding up or slowing down,

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.990
taking a new sensor measurement or even communicating with humans or other robots.

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:28.379
Motors and actuators might turn wheels or

00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:33.284
propellers on a mobile robot or activate joints in robotic arm.

00:00:33.284 --> 00:00:36.839
A robot might take other actions as well,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.230
like power on a laser scanner to take a measurement or

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:44.594
emit a light or sound or send a communication message.

00:00:44.594 --> 00:00:50.649
In this course, you'll get a chance to build and simulate active robotic systems.
