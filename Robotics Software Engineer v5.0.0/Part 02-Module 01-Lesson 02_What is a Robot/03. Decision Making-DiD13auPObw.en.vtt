00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
A robot needs to make decisions based on

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.095
the data from various sensors and its own internal state.

00:00:07.094 --> 00:00:12.149
These decisions can be as simple as answering yes or no question.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.150
Like is the target object present on the table?

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.219
Or the decisions can be extremely

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:21.019
complex like deciding how to navigate an unknown environment.

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:26.149
In practice however, the decision-making process in robotics can require answering

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:28.654
many questions to decide on one course of

00:00:28.655 --> 00:00:32.554
action from among potentially infinite possibilities.

00:00:32.554 --> 00:00:36.335
Along the way, sophisticated techniques might be used.

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:39.620
For example, special tools can extract information

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:43.114
from images or compensate for a measurement error.

00:00:43.115 --> 00:00:44.719
A robot needs to using

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.329
motion planning algorithm to decide how to get from one place to another.

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.969
Then, using a control algorithm to stay on track.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:54.979
In this program, we'll cover

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:59.819
decision-making techniques to give your robots the best brains possible.
