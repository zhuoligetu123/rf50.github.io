00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.605
Robots perceive the world around them through the use of sensors.

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:07.919
You can think of robot sensors as analogous to

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.660
our human senses like sight, hearing, and touch.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.469
There are many different types of sensors used in robotics.

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:19.843
Robots eyes might be analogous to cameras,

00:00:19.844 --> 00:00:23.730
lidar, radar, or even ultrasound.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.105
A microphone could be a robot's ears.

00:00:27.105 --> 00:00:29.879
Giving a robot a sense of touch might be

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:33.615
achieved through the use of temperature or pressure sensors.

00:00:33.615 --> 00:00:39.469
Even senses like taste and smell can be achieved using chemical analyzers.

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.859
Robots can also be equipped with sensors that have

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:47.450
no human analogue like GPS to establish exact position on earth,

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.609
a barometer to track altitude,

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:52.984
or even a magnetic field sensor with actinic.

00:00:52.984 --> 00:00:55.460
In this program, you will gain experience with

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.799
a wide range of sensor modalities and sensor data.
