00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
Robot mapping sounds quite similar to localization.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.585
Instead of assuming an old map and estimating your pose,

00:00:06.585 --> 00:00:09.785
you're assuming an old path and estimating your environment.

00:00:09.785 --> 00:00:11.633
So, what can be so hard?

00:00:11.632 --> 00:00:13.689
Well, your posts can be defined with

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:17.574
some finite number of state variables such as the robot's x and y position.

00:00:17.574 --> 00:00:20.184
In most applications, there are only a handful.

00:00:20.184 --> 00:00:23.844
On the other hand, a map generally lies in a continuous space,

00:00:23.844 --> 00:00:27.429
and as a result, there are infinitely many variables used to describe it.

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:29.469
Couple this with the uncertainties present in

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:32.289
perception and the mapping task becomes even more challenging.

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:34.524
I suppose, there may be

00:00:34.524 --> 00:00:38.125
other challenges too depending on the nature of the space that you are mapping.

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:40.960
For instance, the geometry and whether the space is

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.079
repetitive in the sense that many different places look alike.

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:45.725
Exactly, you're right.

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:49.215
If you're driving through a forest which only contains trees of one type,

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.780
the kind where they are neatly planted in rows.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.670
You're going to have a lot of trouble distinguishing

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.024
between trees and establishing correspondences.

00:00:56.024 --> 00:00:58.140
Thus, making it challenging to map the environment.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.054
In this module, you will be learning how to map an environment.

00:01:02.054 --> 00:01:04.620
There are a number of different mapping algorithms

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.859
and we will be focusing on the occupancy grid mapping algorithm.

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:10.064
With this algorithm, you can map

00:01:10.064 --> 00:01:14.819
any arbitrary environment by dividing it into a finite number of grid cells.

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:17.939
By estimating the sets of each individual cell,

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.170
you will end up with an estimated map of your environment.
