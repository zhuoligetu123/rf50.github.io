00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.019
Automation with robotics is becoming a differentiator in the manufacturing industry.

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:06.869
The skills you need to know for a career in

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.470
this robotics field are changing at the fastest rate in history.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.980
At Udacity, our goal is to empower you with the real world

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.170
relevant skills that make you successful at

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.840
your job today and prepare you for the jobs of tomorrow.

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:21.750
Our Self-Driving Car Nanodegree program allowed students

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.740
the exclusive opportunity to put their code on a real self-driving car.

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:28.469
Now, our robotic students will have the opportunity to

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:32.700
control real KUKA iiwa robots located in Germany.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.520
I am a Professor of Computer Science at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.080
Students will have the opportunity to program these robots.

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.960
The experience with working with physical robots is

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.245
very different from working with robots in simulation.

00:00:48.244 --> 00:00:49.529
This is something very unique,

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.505
you cannot find this in any other online program.

00:00:52.505 --> 00:00:54.080
Even at many universities,

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.905
it's very rare to get access to real topnotch hardware.

00:00:57.905 --> 00:01:02.120
Join Udacity's Robotic Software Engineer nanodegree program to learn the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:06.814
latest in robotics software technology and gain access to this exciting opportunity.

00:01:06.814 --> 00:01:09.509
We look forward to seeing you in the classroom.
