00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
Welcome to the cuckoo path planning project.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.960
In this project, you'll build software to move an object through

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.434
a maze with an industrial six degrees of freedom cuckoo robotic arm.

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:17.054
First, you'll run your project in a gazebo simulator here in the classroom.

00:00:17.054 --> 00:00:21.390
You'll use path planning algorithms to figure out which moves the arm should

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.160
make in order to get from a starting point of the maze to the goal.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.490
You'll use the robotic operating system or ROS to interface with the simulation robot.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.969
Once you've got your algorithm working in the simulator,

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.189
you can submit to the hardware phase of

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:42.199
the project where you will have the opportunity to watch your code

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.770
run on a real cuckoo arm located at the KIT robot learning lab in Germany.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.925
Your objective is to build an efficient path planning algorithm

00:00:52.924 --> 00:00:57.265
that can solve the maze no matter what start and goal poses are given,

00:00:57.265 --> 00:01:00.994
and to get to that solution as quickly as possible.

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:05.120
In this lesson, you'll receive an overview of the project and we'll

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.135
introduce some supplemental materials to help you with ROS and path planning.

00:01:10.135 --> 00:01:12.109
Let's get started.
