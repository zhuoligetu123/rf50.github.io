          Submission:

         <p>
          Participants will compete by submitting their code (“Code”) to program a Kuka robotics arm to navigate a physical 2D maze in the fastest time possible. Students who are currently enrolled or who have successfully completed Term 1 of the Robotics Software Nanodegree Program (“Program”) will find the
          <strong>
           Kuka Project Challenge
          </strong>
          in the extracurricular section the Program classroom.  The code must successfully pass the simulator before it can be run on the Kuka robotic arm at the lab in Germany. To “pass” the simulator, the Code must successfully navigate the robotic arm through the maze from the starting point to the goal point without any errors and without hitting or attempting to move through the walls of the maze.
         </p>
         <p>
          Subject to the Code passing the simulation, it, will be added to the queue to run on the physical robotic arm and run by the KIT team in Karlsruhe, Germany at the Kuka Learning Lab (“Lab”).

          Run-Time:
         </h3>
         <p>
          Participant submissions will be timed at the Lab using standardized software. The Kuka robotics arm will only begin to move after it has planned the path and poses according to the Code provided by the participant. The run-time for the challenge therefore includes both the robotic arm’s time to plan and then execute its movement along the maze. The clock, controlled by KIT’s program for executing the code, will begin when the Code starts to run and end when the robotic arm has moved the object to the goal location within the maze. Reducing the time required to plan the robotic arm’s path is a critical component to winning this Contest.
         </p>
         <p>
          To account for small natural variations that occur in  the code’s run-time,  it will be run on the arm three separate times. The
          <strong>
           median or (middle)
          </strong>
          run-time will be the participant’s recorded time for the Contest. Participants are therefore encouraged to submit Code that runs consistently well rather than Code that is prone to wide variability. A participant’s best and worst run-time will be discarded and not considered for determining the Winner of the Contest.

          Please note that participants are not required to participate in the publicly viewable leaderboard to participate in this Contest. If a participant elects to not to opt-in to the leaderboard, their run-times for each phase will not be visible to other participants. To the extent you opt to be visible in the leaderboard, please keep in mind that this leaderboard will be visible to others in the classroom. You should not share personal information on the leaderboard (e.g., real name, etc.). Please use an anonymous moniker. If you choose to provide your real personal information in the leaderboard, you acknowledge and agree that it will be viewable by others and that such sharing is subject to our Privacy Policy (including the social sharing provisions). If you choose to opt-out after initially opting-in, you may do so, but information you shared prior to opting-out may be residually available/viewable.

         <p>
          The top 5 entrant’s scores will be placed on a leaderboard that can be viewed within the classroom. Student’s real names will not be used on the Leaderboard. Even if you choose not to put your name on the publicly viewable leaderboard, you will be able to see your own run-time so that you can rank it against the leaderboard and your run-time for the final submission will be eligible to win the challenge.
