00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
So far, we focused on the questions of where a robot is with respect to

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.754
a map in localization and how to build a map of the environment in mapping in snap.

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:14.925
These are both critical elements for robotic mobility.

00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:20.685
Now, we'll turn our attention to decision making aspects of mobile robotics,

00:00:20.684 --> 00:00:23.239
path planning and navigation.

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.089
Given a map and the goal position,

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:31.129
path planning is the calculation of a path that gets the robot where it needs to go.

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:32.824
Once a path is in place,

00:00:32.825 --> 00:00:36.230
the robot must navigate to the goal and may encounter

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:40.519
on-map obstacles along the way that conflict with the planned path.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.500
With real-time sensor readings,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.240
the robot can use obstacle avoidance techniques to modify the original path.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.230
While path planning is a strategic solution to the problem of,

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:52.564
"How do I get there?"

00:00:52.564 --> 00:00:54.949
obstacle avoidance is a series of

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.540
tactical decisions the robot must take as it moves along its path.

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.244
There are multiple approaches for accomplishing both.

00:01:03.244 --> 00:01:07.594
In this module, you learn a number of path planning approaches,

00:01:07.594 --> 00:01:10.194
both classical and probabilistic.

00:01:10.194 --> 00:01:12.839
Practice what you've learned in the lab.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.579
In the final project,

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:19.525
you'll put together robotic algorithm you've learned to program a home service robot.

00:01:19.525 --> 00:01:23.935
Your robot will autonomously map an environment and then

00:01:23.935 --> 00:01:29.170
navigate through that environment to pick up and drop off virtual objects.
