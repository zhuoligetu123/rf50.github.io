00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.484
Hello. Welcome to our autonomous systems interview course.

00:00:03.484 --> 00:00:07.679
I'm Michael, the learning technologist from our self-driving car team here at Udacity.

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:10.800
I'm a graduate of the School of autonomous systems myself,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.170
as I completed the self-driving car engineer in

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:16.125
every program prior to joining Udacity and now,

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:19.445
I'm responsible for leading constant updates we make to the program.

00:00:19.445 --> 00:00:23.929
Today, we're here to help you interview for a job and all things autonomous,

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:25.390
whether it be robotics,

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.175
self-driving cars, flying cars and more.

00:00:28.175 --> 00:00:31.245
First, we're going to show you some example interviews.

00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:34.750
You'll watch to see how the interviewees responds to each question,

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.250
how they worked through the problem at hand and how

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.994
they show their interviewer their thought process.

00:00:39.994 --> 00:00:42.169
After each video, you'll have the chance to

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.204
reflect on what you thought the interviewee did well,

00:00:45.204 --> 00:00:47.869
what they didn't do well and then hear from

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:51.754
the interviewer themselves on what they thought of the approach and answer.

00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:56.995
A big item to note here is the focus is not just on solving the problem quickly,

00:00:56.994 --> 00:01:01.280
the interviewer wants to see your thought process behind tackling the problem.
