00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
One way you can narrow down the topics for your interview is

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.470
by looking at the job descriptions for each position you apply to.

00:00:06.469 --> 00:00:09.480
If C++ is a primary language listed,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.995
you'll be best served by practicing in this.

00:00:11.994 --> 00:00:16.259
If not, lean toward the language of the companies you're most interested in.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.490
Make sure if you list a programming language on your resume,

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:21.734
you're prepared to answer a question with it.

00:00:21.734 --> 00:00:25.519
Companies want to measure your proficiency in what you've listed.

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.420
Also, if there's a responsibility or minimum requirement listed for the job,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.704
expect that to be a potential area of questioning in the interview.

00:00:34.704 --> 00:00:37.670
Before your interview, you should also consider asking

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.465
your recruiter who you will interview with and what the topics of the interview will be.

00:00:42.465 --> 00:00:46.055
That might first narrow down what you need to prepare for.

00:00:46.054 --> 00:00:48.829
Let's walk through a recent job posting for

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.619
a machine learning and computer vision engineer to see what we can gather.

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:55.729
To start, most companies put some information

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:58.390
at the top about what the company and team does.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.664
Make sure you know this information and do some research on your own as well.

00:01:02.664 --> 00:01:05.920
You'll definitely get asked why you're interested in this company

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.820
and often get asked on what you know about what the company does.

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:12.019
You want to be able to give an answer that goes

00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:15.435
deeper than just common knowledge about the company.

00:01:15.435 --> 00:01:18.730
This may not have been apparent from the job title alone,

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.790
but this rule actually relates their mapping and localization team as

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.645
well but in applying machine learning and computer vision toward it.

00:01:25.644 --> 00:01:29.414
So, you'll want to prepare for the primary roles topics,

00:01:29.415 --> 00:01:34.180
the localization and mapping will also likely be an area of this interview.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.760
Now that we're to their responsibilities section,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.060
we can tell SLAM,

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.340
computer vision and machine learning are part of the normal responsibilities or the role.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.579
It also mentions staying current with the latest research, visiting conferences,

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.299
et cetera, which means you'll either be asked about

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.530
some recent papers you've read or conferences you've attended.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.700
Alternatively, you should bring these up in

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.820
your interview if you feel you stand out in this area.

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.519
The last two responsibilities in deploying

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:03.179
production code and working with international teams,

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.660
will likely be a question of explaining the time you've done so, if applicable.

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.049
Showing why you're a great teammate is important for any role.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.780
Let's move to experience and skills.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.340
If you made it past a phone screen and onto a technical interview,

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.170
it typically means you have at least met

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:23.629
the minimum experience and skills they want to see for the position.

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.479
We can still utilize this for

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.614
some predictions of questions you might be asked for this role.

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:31.719
Again, we see a mention of recent research.

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:35.669
So, be prepared to talk about anything you've read lately in the area.

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:38.289
Next, a key item here is listing out

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:40.900
various deep learning and machine learning algorithms.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.724
You'll likely be asked to code something using one of these libraries.

00:02:44.724 --> 00:02:47.469
Next up, it mentions mathematical skills.

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:51.805
So, you may be asked to solve a fairly complex mathematical problem.

00:02:51.805 --> 00:02:54.310
This may be fairly far reaching but it's

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.849
likely related to a problem in machine learning or mapping,

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.465
based on what we've seen so far.

00:02:59.465 --> 00:03:04.750
Lastly, it mentions algorithms in C++ which is another reminder for

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.909
you that this autonomous systems interview course is just one piece of the puzzle here.

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.335
Many jobs also have a nice to have or ways to stand out section.

00:03:14.335 --> 00:03:16.215
Here, we see mapping,

00:03:16.215 --> 00:03:19.780
geometry, robotics, and autonomous driving technology.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.465
If you've taken one of our nano degree programs in autonomous systems,

00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:26.020
you have experience in each of these.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.630
Make sure to both highlight these on your resume and to bring them up in

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.960
your interview even if you aren't specifically asked directly about them.
