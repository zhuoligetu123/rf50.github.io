00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.565
Aaron had a great answer on motion planning.

00:00:02.565 --> 00:00:05.640
He went through and went from very basic steps and slowly

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:09.089
advanced up from a single car driving on the highway by itself,

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:10.859
to adding an additional vehicles,

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:12.629
and then having even the crosswalk,

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.710
which was in my original question of how to go through.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.820
That really showed he was indicating from a very base case to the more advanced case,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.160
how he would build out a more complex environment for his motion planning.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.405
He also went into model predictive control,

00:00:29.405 --> 00:00:30.745
which I thought was interesting,

00:00:30.745 --> 00:00:32.380
and when I asked him about that,

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.340
it showed that he really had experience above and beyond what I would

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.510
probably expect for people coming into the company at that point.

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:40.140
So, for those reasons,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.799
I thought it was a great answer.
