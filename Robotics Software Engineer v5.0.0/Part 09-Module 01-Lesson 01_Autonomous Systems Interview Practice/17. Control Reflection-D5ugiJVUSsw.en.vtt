00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.839
Halyon had a fairly good answer for his PID controller.

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:05.960
He went through each step of proportional,

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.949
integral, and derivative, and explained each of these well,

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:12.119
and how they relate to the overall PID controller equation,

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:14.479
which is what gets output for steering angle,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.605
for instance, or for a robotic arm.

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:20.265
One of the things I would say that he could do better was the first time he went through.

00:00:20.265 --> 00:00:22.355
He mainly did things in pseudocode.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:27.140
I prompted him a little bit to say what would you do if this within C++,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.920
and he did a good job to add

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.300
his type declarations like floats as well as initializing things to zero,

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:35.709
if they needed to be, and adding semicolons.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.520
Other than that though, I thought he gave a great answer.
