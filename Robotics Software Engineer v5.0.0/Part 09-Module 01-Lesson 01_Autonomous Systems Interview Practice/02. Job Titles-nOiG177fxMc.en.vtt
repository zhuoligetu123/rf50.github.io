00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.569
One item to consider before we get to the interviews themselves,

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:06.500
is about the jobs requiring autonomous system skills.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.660
While certain companies do have more overarching titles,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.150
it's most common that jobs you apply to will have

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.175
much more specific roles like motion plane engineer,

00:00:15.175 --> 00:00:17.620
controls engineer, or perception engineer.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.519
As such, the interviews you're about to see will each

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.480
be specific to one type of these roles.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.660
We suggest going through each one of these,

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.690
as you'll see different individuals going through

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.725
their own separate approaches to problem-solving their interview question.

00:00:31.725 --> 00:00:35.850
While the question itself might not be specific to the role you're looking for,

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.920
perhaps the interviews thinking will boost you in your own interview.
