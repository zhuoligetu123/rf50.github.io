00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
All right. Now that we've covered some of the basics

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.280
of interviewing for autonomous systems rules,

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.355
let's get started on watching interviews.

00:00:07.355 --> 00:00:09.955
Remember, over the next few videos,

00:00:09.955 --> 00:00:12.495
you'll watch various candidates for different roles

00:00:12.494 --> 00:00:15.554
approach a problem given to them by their interviewers.

00:00:15.554 --> 00:00:19.859
For each candidate considered taking notes on how they approach the problem,

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.074
what they could do well or can improve on and anything else you find important.

00:00:24.074 --> 00:00:27.714
After each video, you'll have a chance to reflect on their performance.

00:00:27.714 --> 00:00:32.604
Really try to put yourself in the interviewer's shoes as to how the candidate performed.

00:00:32.604 --> 00:00:36.538
If you were the hiring manager or a teammate for someone hiring in this role,

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.880
is this someone you trust to be capable and

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.775
competent in performing the job responsibilities?

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:45.445
Not every one of these candidates will have a perfect response.

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:47.744
After you've gotten a chance to reflect,

00:00:47.744 --> 00:00:50.789
you'll hear from the interviewer themselves as well.

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.765
Make sure to compare their thoughts against your own.

00:00:53.765 --> 00:00:56.359
I'll see you again after the interviews.
