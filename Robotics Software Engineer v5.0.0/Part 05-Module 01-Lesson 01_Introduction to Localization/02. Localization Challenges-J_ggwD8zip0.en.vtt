00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.464
Before we dive into the specific localization algorithms,

00:00:03.464 --> 00:00:06.004
let's define the localization problem.

00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:09.984
Firstly, there are three different types of localization problems.

00:00:09.984 --> 00:00:12.209
These problems are not all equal.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.700
The amount of information present and the nature of the environment that a robot

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:20.064
is operating in determine the difficulty of the localization task.

00:00:20.065 --> 00:00:23.475
The easiest localization problem is called Position Tracking,

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:25.620
also known as Local Localization.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.160
In this problem, the robot knows its initial pose and

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.125
the localization challenge entails

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:35.189
estimating the robot's pose as it moves out on the environment.

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:37.736
This problem is not as trivial as you might think

00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:40.950
since there is always some uncertainty in robot motion.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.180
However, the uncertainty is limited to regions surrounding the robot.

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:49.655
A more complicated localization challenge is called Global Localization,

00:00:49.655 --> 00:00:51.570
which you've already seen.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.734
In this case, the robot's initial pose is unknown

00:00:54.734 --> 00:00:59.034
and the robot must determine its pose relative to the ground truth map.

00:00:59.034 --> 00:01:00.269
The amount of uncertainty in

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.020
Global Localization is much greater than that in Position Tracking,

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.250
making it a much more difficult problem.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.629
Now, the most challenging localization problem is the Kidnapped Robot problem.

00:01:11.629 --> 00:01:15.060
This problem is just like Global Localization except that

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.420
the robot may be kidnapped at any time and moved to a new location on the map.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.635
How often does that happen, Karim?

00:01:21.635 --> 00:01:24.900
I didn't realize that robot kidnapping is such a common occurrence.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.695
Well, Julia, it's quite uncommon but think of it as the worst possible case.

00:01:29.694 --> 00:01:34.750
And as roboticists, we should always design robots to deal with the worst circumstances.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.935
But keep in mind that localization algorithms are not free from

00:01:37.935 --> 00:01:42.325
error and there will be instances of a robot miscalculating where it is.

00:01:42.325 --> 00:01:46.674
The Kidnapped Robot problem teaches the robot to recover from such instances,

00:01:46.674 --> 00:01:50.334
and once again, correctly locate itself on a map.

00:01:50.334 --> 00:01:54.000
Doing so is critical to building robot's localization algorithms.
