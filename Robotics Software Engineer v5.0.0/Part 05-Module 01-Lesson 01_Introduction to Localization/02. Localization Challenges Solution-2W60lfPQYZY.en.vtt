00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.424
So far, we have characterized the three most important localization problems.

00:00:04.424 --> 00:00:08.250
In the real world, we still have to consider whether environment is static,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.150
meaning unchanging, or dynamic where objects may shift over time.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.300
Dynamic environments are more challenging to localize in.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.640
But we'll focus only on

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.000
static environments where the environment always matches the ground truth.
