00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
Congratulations, you've just built three fundamental application with Gazebo.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.009
In the model editor tool of Gazebo,

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:12.449
you simulated a two-wheeled robot and included it in a Gazebo world.

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:16.289
Next, you have the plug-in to interact with the world.

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.794
Then, in the building editor tool,

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:21.179
you both have space to house your robot.

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.780
I hope you are now able to differentiate between a model,

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.975
a world, and a plug-in in Gazebo.

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:33.304
This is just the beginning as there is a lot more to learn with Gazebo.

00:00:33.304 --> 00:00:37.009
You will be learning some of the advanced topics in the next lessons.

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:39.739
For now, spend some time practicing and

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.700
explore the official Gazebo tutorials on their site.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.595
I included the link for you and description section below.

00:00:46.594 --> 00:00:48.769
Once you feel that you practice enough,

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.970
move on to the project.
