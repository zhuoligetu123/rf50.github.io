00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.734
So far, you have simulated a robot in Gazebo.

00:00:03.734 --> 00:00:07.814
Now, you will learn how to design a building to house it in.

00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:10.800
Since many robots are placed indoors,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.950
inside commercial or residential buildings,

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:16.699
you will learn how to simulate such a space.

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.019
There's a user-friendly cat tool in Gazebo known

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.585
as the building editor which helps you accomplish this task.

00:00:23.585 --> 00:00:25.880
Let's get back to our workspace,

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:28.000
and explore the building editor tool.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.405
To open the building editor,

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:33.880
first launch Gazebo from a terminal,

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.734
and then click edit building editor.

00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:43.768
The building editor is divided into three main sections,

00:00:43.768 --> 00:00:46.964
the palate, the 2D view,

00:00:46.965 --> 00:00:48.510
and the 3D view.

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:50.085
Inside the 2D view,

00:00:50.085 --> 00:00:52.980
there's a graph paper and the scale.

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:56.265
Here, you can design a building floor plan.

00:00:56.265 --> 00:01:00.935
To do that, you have to select from the pallet walls,

00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:05.600
windows, doors or even stairs.

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:10.534
You can also add colors and texture to your building.

00:01:10.534 --> 00:01:12.604
With the import tool,

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:17.620
you can import a map that you previously drew with your favorite cat software.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.439
Inside the 3D view,

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.974
you can see a preview of your building.

00:01:21.974 --> 00:01:27.844
For now, create a space by drawing this U-shape in the building editor.

00:01:27.844 --> 00:01:31.519
I chose this sketch because of its simplicity.

00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:38.959
This shape has the dimensions of 10 meters by 10 meters with a thickness of 2.5 meters.

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:44.030
Now, adjust the scale then select walls,

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.070
and start drawing the floor plan.

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:02.954
Next, you can double-click on any wall to 2D view to edit its height,

00:02:02.954 --> 00:02:07.269
length, start, and end position.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.180
Finally, apply a blue color to your house.

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.769
In the 3D view,

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.594
you can see a preview of the house you just built.

00:02:21.594 --> 00:02:24.259
Once you are satisfied with your design,

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:28.139
save it to the model directory of your project.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.935
Now, this model can be easily imported to the Gazebo word to house a robot.

00:02:45.935 --> 00:02:53.129
Finally, exit the building editor and go back to the Gazebo word main interface.
