Build a single floor wall structure using the **Building Editor** tool in Gazebo. Apply at least one feature, one color, and optionally one texture to your structure. Make sure there's enough space between the walls for a robot to navigate.  \n2. Model any object of your choice using the **Model Editor** tool in Gazebo. Your model links should be connected with joints. \n3. Import your structure and two instances of your model inside an empty **Gazebo World**.\n4. Import at least one model from the **Gazebo online library** and implement it in your existing Gazebo world. \n5. Write a C++ **World Plugin** to interact with your world. Your code should display “Welcome to <your name>’s World!” message as soon as you launch the Gazebo world file. \n\nThese tasks are just the basic requirements for you to pass the project! Feel free to have fun designing and importing multiple models. \n\n## Evaluation\nOnce you finish designing your world in Gazebo, check the [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2346/view) to see if your world meets the specifications. If so, then you are ready to submit!\n\n## Submission Folder\nHere are the files that you need to include in your project submission folder:\n* **model** folder:\n * Any object or robot designed in the Model Editor tool of Gazebo\n * A single floor structure designed in the Building Editor tool of Gazebo\n* **world** folder:\n * Gazebo world file that includes the models\n* **script** folder:\n * Gazebo world plugin C++ script\n* **CMakeLists.txt** file to link the C++ code to libraries\n\n## Ready to submit your project?\nClick on the \"Submit Project\" button and follow the instructions to submit!\n\n## Project Submission Checklist\n\n**Before submitting your project, please review and confirm the following items.** \n<input type=\"checkbox\"> I am confident all rubric items have been met and my project will pass as submitted. \n<input type=\"checkbox\"> Project builds correctly without errors and runs.\n<input type=\"checkbox\"> All required functionality exists and my project behaves as expected per the project's specifications.\n\n**Once you have checked all these items, you are ready to submit!**\n\n\n",

As before, follow these simple steps to boot up Gazebo in your Workspace:\n\n* First, enable the GPU on your workspace by clicking `Enable GPU.` \n* Open the visual desktop by clicking on `Go to Desktop.` The workspace is best supported on **Google Chrome** and might not load on other browsers. \n* Then, update and upgrade the Workspace image to get the latest features of Gazebo. To do so, open a terminal, and write the following statement:\n```sh\n$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y \n```\n\n **Note**: Remember to update and upgrade your image after each reboot since these updates(or any package that you install) are not permanent. Ignore any error you get while upgrading. \n\n\n* Now launch Gazebo from the terminal by typing:\n```sh\n$ gazebo\n```\n\nBe advised that occasionally Gazebo gets stuck in a loading loop. If Gazebo does not fully load after about one minute, try closing it by pressing Ctrl+C while the Gazebo terminal is active. Then, try running the command again to restart Gazebo.",
