00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.714
Here's the graphical representation of the SLAM problem.

00:00:03.714 --> 00:00:06.835
Giving the measurements z and the control is u,

00:00:06.835 --> 00:00:09.599
you will learn how to solve the posterior map,

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.059
m along with the posees, x.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.214
The SLAM problem comes in two different forms,

00:00:16.214 --> 00:00:19.152
the Online SLAM and the Full SLAM.

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.644
Both forms are important in robotics,

00:00:21.644 --> 00:00:24.780
since you'll encounter SLAM algorithms that solve

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.070
either the Online SLAM problem or the Full SLAM problem.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.039
Some algorithm will even solve both problems.

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:35.939
Let's start with the Online SLAM problem.

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:39.554
At time t-1, the robot will estimate its current pose,

00:00:39.554 --> 00:00:41.963
xz-1, and the map,

00:00:41.963 --> 00:00:44.689
m, giving its current measurements,

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:48.734
Zt-1, and controls Ut-1.

00:00:48.734 --> 00:00:51.195
Then, at time t,

00:00:51.195 --> 00:00:54.030
the robot will estimate its new post, Xt,

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.660
and the map, m, given only its current measurements Zt, and controls Ut.

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.469
Notice how the previous measurements and controls are not taken into

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:09.465
consideration when computing the new estimate of the pose and the map.

00:01:09.465 --> 00:01:11.775
Finally, at time, t+1,

00:01:11.775 --> 00:01:16.609
the robot will estimate its current post Xt+1 and the map, m,

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:21.819
giving the measurements Zt+1 and controls Ut+1.

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:25.214
Thus, with the Online SLAM problem,

00:01:25.215 --> 00:01:31.734
you solve instantaneous poses independently from previous measurements and controls.

00:01:31.734 --> 00:01:35.814
This problem can be model with the probability equation,

00:01:35.814 --> 00:01:39.390
P of xt, m, giving z1:t,

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:46.722
u1:t, where we solve the posterior represented by instantaneous pose and the map,

00:01:46.722 --> 00:01:48.989
giving the measurements and controls.

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:51.439
So with the Online SLAM,

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.000
we estimate variables that occur at time t only.
