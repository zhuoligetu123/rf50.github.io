00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.779
I hope you had a chance to interface with turtlebot with

00:00:02.779 --> 00:00:06.855
a G-mapping package to build the map of the Willow Garage environment.

00:00:06.855 --> 00:00:09.554
If not, follow along with this video,

00:00:09.554 --> 00:00:13.699
as I'll walk you through the steps of performing snap with your turtlebot.

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:19.489
Feel free to pause this video at any time and refer to the steps in the instructed notes.

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:22.189
Now, let's jump back in our virtual machine.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.929
First, I'll open the terminal,

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.844
navigate the source directory of my catkin work space,

00:00:28.844 --> 00:00:31.219
and clone the package.

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:36.104
Then, install its system dependencies and finally,

00:00:36.104 --> 00:00:38.944
with the catkin workspace.

00:00:38.945 --> 00:00:45.649
Now that you have all the required packages in your workspace, let's launch the nodes.

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.074
In this terminal, source your workspace.

00:00:50.075 --> 00:00:52.475
And as we did earlier,

00:00:52.475 --> 00:00:58.289
launch the turtlebot gazebo node in a Willow Garage environment.

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.015
Open another terminal, again source your workspace,

00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:05.144
and launch the keyboard teleop node,

00:01:05.144 --> 00:01:07.179
don't move your robot yet.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.425
To understand the G-mapping node,

00:01:09.424 --> 00:01:11.494
open a third terminal,

00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:16.280
source the workspace, and run the node.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.394
Your node should now be registering the first scan.

00:01:21.394 --> 00:01:23.549
Now, in a new terminal, run rviz,

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.134
to subscribe to different published topics and visualize the map.

00:01:29.135 --> 00:01:34.085
In rviz, change the fixed frame to base link,

00:01:34.084 --> 00:01:40.679
then change the reference frame to odom.

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:53.137
Add the RobotModel. To visualize the environment, add

00:01:53.138 --> 00:02:01.365
a Camera and change the topic to the RGB1.

00:02:01.365 --> 00:02:04.090
Finally,

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:12.396
add the Map and select the map topic.

00:02:12.396 --> 00:02:16.929
The first section of the map is now appearing.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.115
Now, map the Willow Garage environment

00:02:20.115 --> 00:02:24.314
by driving your robot around with a keyboard teleop commands.

00:02:24.314 --> 00:02:27.314
After you are satisfied with the result,

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:34.509
navigate your desktop and save a copy of the map by running the map server command.

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:37.169
Feel free to experiment SLAM with

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:41.000
different environments and share the image of the map with your classmates.
