00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
The fastSLAM algorithm, uses

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.049
a custom particle filter approach to solve

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:08.300
the full SLAM problem with known correspondences.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:15.658
Using particles, fastSLAM estimates a posterior over the robot path along with the map.

00:00:15.657 --> 00:00:19.254
Each of these particles holds the robot trajectory which will give

00:00:19.254 --> 00:00:23.585
an advantage to SLAM to solve the problem of mapping with known poses.

00:00:23.585 --> 00:00:25.638
In addition to the robot trajectory,

00:00:25.638 --> 00:00:31.536
each particle holds a map and each feature of the map is represented by a local Gaussian.

00:00:31.536 --> 00:00:34.024
With the fastSLAM algorithm,

00:00:34.024 --> 00:00:37.707
the problem is now divided into separate independent problem.

00:00:37.707 --> 00:00:42.394
Each of which aims to solve the problem of estimating features of the map.

00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:45.275
To solve these independent mini problems,

00:00:45.274 --> 00:00:49.219
FastSLAM will use the low dimensional extended Kalman filter.

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.144
While math features are treated independently,

00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:56.890
dependency only exists between robot pose uncertainty.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.756
This custom approach of representing posterior with particle filter

00:00:59.756 --> 00:01:06.000
and Gaussian is known by the Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter One.
