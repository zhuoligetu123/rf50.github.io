00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.734
So far, we've covered the Online SLAM problem.

00:00:03.734 --> 00:00:10.080
Now, it's time to dive deeper in the Full SLAM problem also known as off-line SLAM.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.615
While solving the Full SLAM problem,

00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:15.730
you will estimate the entire path up to time t

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.699
instead of an instantaneous pose given all the measurements and controls.

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.660
Now, let's model this graphical representation of

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.024
the Full SLAM problem in a probability function. Here's the result.

00:00:30.024 --> 00:00:34.381
P of X1 up to time t and m,

00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:42.265
giving z1 to t and u one to T. This function estimates the posterior over the entire path

00:00:42.265 --> 00:00:46.134
along the map given all the measurements and controls up to time

00:00:46.134 --> 00:00:50.934
t. Now that you've seen both the Online and Full SLAM problem,

00:00:50.935 --> 00:00:54.850
let's compare them, and see if a relation exists between them.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.950
Clearly, the difference between the two forms of SLAM is in their poses.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.325
One represents a posterior over the entire path,

00:01:03.325 --> 00:01:07.965
while the other this represents a posterior over the current pose.

00:01:07.965 --> 00:01:11.909
Now, is there any relation between these two forms of SLAM?

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.390
Yes. A relation between the Online SLAM problem,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.629
and the Full SLAM exists by integrating

00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:22.560
the previous poses from the Full SLAM problem once at a time,

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.320
you obtain the Online SLAM problem.
