00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.219
Now that you've learned the extended Kalman filter and its implementation in robotics,

00:00:04.219 --> 00:00:07.574
it's time to use the power of ROS and implement an EKF package.

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:10.949
In this lab, we've controlled a robot inside a simulator and you

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:14.474
collect sensitive information from the robots inertial measurement unit,

00:00:14.474 --> 00:00:16.995
rotary encoders and vision sensors.

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:19.679
Then you'll apply an EKF ROS package to this robot.

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:23.219
The EKF ROS package will compare data generated from

00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:25.349
the robot's onboard sensors and apply

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.410
sensor fusion to estimate the robot's pose as it moves around.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.759
Within this lab, you'll be working with five different ROS packages,

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.082
each with a different purpose;

00:00:35.082 --> 00:00:39.810
the turtlebot gazebo package which launches a mobile robot inside a gazebot environment,

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.407
the robot_pose_ekf package which will estimate the position and orientation of the robot,

00:00:45.406 --> 00:00:47.919
the odom_to_trajectory package which will open

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.840
the odometry values generated over time into a trajectory path,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.460
the turtlebot_teleop package which will let you drive the robot using keyboard commands.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.609
Finally, the rviz package which will let

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.265
you visualize the estimated position and orientation of the robot.

00:01:03.265 --> 00:01:04.930
While working through this lab,

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.830
you'll learn how to go through the documentation of ROS packages,

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:10.394
identify the subscriber and publisher topics,

00:01:10.394 --> 00:01:14.549
and then make the necessary changes to integrate the different packages.

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.750
By the end of this lab,

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.459
you'll know how to merge all the nodes of

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:20.489
the five different packages into a single launch file.

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:23.429
Then, you'll be able to launch your project with a single command.
