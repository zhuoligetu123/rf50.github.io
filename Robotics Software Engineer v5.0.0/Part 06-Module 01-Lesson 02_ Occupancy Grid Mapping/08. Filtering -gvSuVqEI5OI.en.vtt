00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.609
So far, we have managed to represent

00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:06.449
the probability of grid cells using the factorization method.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.449
Due to factorization, we are now solving

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:11.969
a binary estimation problem in which

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.310
grid cells holds a static state that do not change over time.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.984
By static, I mean that the state of the system does not change during sensing.

00:00:21.984 --> 00:00:25.577
Locally, a filter to this problem exists,

00:00:25.577 --> 00:00:28.149
and is known as the Binary Bayes Filter.

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:30.699
The Binary Bayes Filter solves

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.570
the static problems by taking the log odds ratio of the belief.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.145
With static state, the belief is now a function of the measurements only.

00:00:39.145 --> 00:00:41.935
Depending on the measurement values reflected,

00:00:41.935 --> 00:00:44.664
the state of the grid cell is updated,

00:00:44.664 --> 00:00:48.594
and this belief is known by the inverse measurement model

00:00:48.594 --> 00:00:53.155
which represents the binary state of grid cells with respect to measurements.

00:00:53.155 --> 00:00:56.710
The inverse measurement model is generally used when

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.609
measurements are more complex than the binary static state.

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:05.170
Let's take an example of a mobile robot equipped with an RGB-D camera.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.894
Here's the robot mission is to estimate if this door is open or closed.

00:01:09.894 --> 00:01:14.213
The field of measurements represented by the camera images is huge

00:01:14.213 --> 00:01:19.239
compared to a simple binary state of the door either open or close.

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:22.299
In such situation, it's always easier to use

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.869
an inverse sensor model than a forward sensor model.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.910
As I mentioned earlier,

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.229
the Binary Bayes Filter will solve

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.594
the inverse measurement model with the log odds ratio representation.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:39.019
To represent the belief in log odds ratio for lt,

00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:42.619
Binary Bayes Filter divides the belief by

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.390
its negate and then take the logarithmic form of this expression.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.844
The advantage of using

00:01:48.844 --> 00:01:54.920
a log odds ratio representation is to avoid probability instabilities near zero or one.
