00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.744
In the Occupancy Grid Mapping Algorithm,

00:00:02.744 --> 00:00:06.705
you saw the inverse sensor model which is the probability of the map

00:00:06.705 --> 00:00:11.565
giving the measurements and the poses in its log odds representation.

00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:14.250
As a reminder, the advantage of using

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.800
log odds representation is to avoid any numerical instabilities near zero or one.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.860
To demonstrate that, let's recover the probability of

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.045
the map giving the data from the log odds representation.

00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:32.820
Now, you can see how the probability of the map is bounded between zero and one.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.310
Mobile robots equipped with range finder sensors instantaneously

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.000
detect obstacles and return measurements in a conical field of view.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.770
At the border of this cone robots can only sense portion of

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.670
the cells and thus, probabilities are weak.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.455
Due to weak probabilities,

00:00:51.455 --> 00:00:56.435
it's hard and complex to compute the state of the cells at the border of the cone.

00:00:56.435 --> 00:01:01.040
To simplify this problem and estimate the state of the cells within,

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.040
at the border and outside of the measurement cone

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.400
an inverse sensor model algorithm is introduced.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.525
With this algorithm, you can estimate if the current cell is free, occupied or unknown.

00:01:14.525 --> 00:01:18.395
The inverse sensor model algorithm takes each cell,

00:01:18.395 --> 00:01:22.195
the poses and measurements as parameters.

00:01:22.195 --> 00:01:26.630
First, the range for the center of mass of the cell is computed.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.945
Here, x_i and y_i are the center of mass of the cell m_i.

00:01:32.945 --> 00:01:36.280
R is the range for the center of mass,

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.775
computed with respect to the center of mass and robot position.

00:01:40.775 --> 00:01:44.270
Next, the beam index k is computed with

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.155
respect to the center of mass of the cell and the robot pose.

00:01:48.155 --> 00:01:50.950
Now, two parameters are introduced.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.020
Beta is the opening angle of the mean and alpha,

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.135
it's the width of the region.

00:01:57.135 --> 00:02:00.320
If a cell lies outside the measurement range of

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.825
the sensor beam or more than alpha over two behind it's detected range,

00:02:04.825 --> 00:02:10.370
then the state of this cell is considered as unknown and it's

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:16.205
initial or prior state l0 and it's log odds form is returned.

00:02:16.205 --> 00:02:20.630
Now, the cell is considered as occupied if it ranges

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.535
between negative and positive alpha over two of the detected range.

00:02:25.535 --> 00:02:29.600
Finally, the cell is considered as free if the range of

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.410
this cell is shorter than the measured range by more than alpha over two.
