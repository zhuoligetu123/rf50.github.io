00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
Now that you have an understanding of some of the fundamental concepts of loss,

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.380
we can dive right into the Command Line where we create

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.890
little turtle robots with a package called TurtleSim.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.350
We should probably stop so I can explain

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.949
what little turtles have to do with robotics in the first place.

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.839
The use of turtles in robotics goes way back to the 1940s.

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:27.149
Early roboticist William Grey Walter created some of the first autonomous devices,

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:31.289
turtle robots which he called Elmer and Elsie.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.780
In the 1960s at MIT,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.785
Seymour Papert used turtle robots in robotics education.

00:00:37.784 --> 00:00:40.949
Seymour's robots could perform a few basic functions.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.030
They could move forward or backwards by a given distance,

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.609
rotate by a given angle and they could

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:49.759
drop the pen from their bellies allowing them to throw as they move.

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:53.509
These primitive functions could be triggered simultaneously allowing

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:57.784
the robots to move along complex trajectories and make sophisticated drawings.

00:00:57.784 --> 00:01:02.644
This connection between robots and turtles continues to this very day.

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:04.790
In your first exercise with us,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.400
you'll be launching your own simulator turtle robot.
