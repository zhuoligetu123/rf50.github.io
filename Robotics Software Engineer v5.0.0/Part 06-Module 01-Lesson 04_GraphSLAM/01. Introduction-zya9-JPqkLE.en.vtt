00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
Welcome. In this lesson,

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.745
you'll be learning about another flavor of slam called GraphSLAM.

00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:10.620
GraphSLAM is a slam algorithm that solves the full slam problem.

00:00:10.618 --> 00:00:14.684
This means that the algorithm recovers the entire path and map,

00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:17.940
instead of just the most recent pose and map.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.150
This difference allows it to consider dependencies between current and previous poses.

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:27.734
One example of our GraphSLAM would be applicable is an underground mining.

00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:29.480
Large machines called bores,

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.355
spent every day cutting away at the rockface.

00:00:32.353 --> 00:00:34.390
The environment changes rapidly,

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.094
and it's important to keep an accurate map of the workspace.

00:00:38.094 --> 00:00:40.920
One way to map this space would be to drive a vehicle with

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.265
a LIDAR around the environment and collects data about the surroundings.

00:00:45.265 --> 00:00:46.814
Then, after the fact,

00:00:46.814 --> 00:00:51.009
the data can be analyzed to create an accurate map of the environment.

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:53.009
As you learn about GraphSLAM,

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:55.768
you will understand some of the benefits of the algorithm,

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.840
including the reduced need for significant onboard processing capability.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.405
One advantage that can be immediately appreciated

00:01:03.405 --> 00:01:06.855
is GraphSLAM's improved accuracy over FastSLAM.

00:01:06.855 --> 00:01:11.520
FastSLAM uses particles to estimate the robot's most likely pose.

00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:13.739
However, at any point in time,

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:18.034
it's possible that there isn't a particle in the most likely location.

00:01:18.034 --> 00:01:23.519
In fact, the chances are slim to none especially, in large environments.

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:25.978
Since GraphSLAM solves the full slam problem,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.189
this means that it can work with all of the data at once to find the optimal solution.

00:01:31.188 --> 00:01:35.500
FastSLAM uses tidbits of information with a finite number of particles,

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.188
so there is room for error.

00:01:37.188 --> 00:01:40.949
In this lesson, you will learn the fundamentals of GraphSLAM;

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.510
how to construct the graphs,

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.145
how to optimize within their constraints to create the most likely set of poses and map,

00:01:47.144 --> 00:01:51.000
and how to overcome some of GraphSLAM's limitations.
