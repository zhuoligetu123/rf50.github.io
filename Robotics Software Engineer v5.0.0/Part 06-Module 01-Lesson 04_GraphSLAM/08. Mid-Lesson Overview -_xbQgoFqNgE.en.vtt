00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.459
At this point, you might be thinking,

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:04.890
I could really use a break from performing

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:08.804
math calculations or there must be a better way.

00:00:08.804 --> 00:00:10.650
Well, there is.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.040
You'll briefly be introduced to the notation used to represent

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.137
multidimensional measurement and motion constraints.

00:00:17.138 --> 00:00:21.540
And then you'll learn about information matrices and information vectors.

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.199
These are data structures that will store constraint to information

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.549
and simplify the process of solving the linear system of equations.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.245
In a linear system,

00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:36.100
adding a constraint is as easy as adding several values to the matrix and vector.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.965
Then, when you've added all the information, you can solve it.

00:00:39.965 --> 00:00:43.640
After that, we're going to face the unfortunate truth that

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.494
much of what robots experience in the world just isn't linear.

00:00:47.494 --> 00:00:51.079
We're going to look at how we can cope with this by once again,

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.884
linearizing the nonlinear motion and measurement models using our favorite Jacobian's.

00:00:56.884 --> 00:01:02.239
Lastly, it is not always efficient to solve a system of equations analytically.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.180
So we will revisit a numerical technique that you learned

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.820
earlier and apply it to graph optimization.
