Since its success with the Apollo program,

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:04.379
the Kalman filter has become one of

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:08.099
the most practical algorithms in the field of controls engineering.

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.719
Today the Kalman filter is applied in many different disciplines within

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.150
engineering the Kalman filter is often used to

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.524
estimate the state of a system when the measurements are noisy.

00:00:18.524 --> 00:00:21.509
For example, the fluid level in a tank,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.220
or as you saw earlier, position tracking of a mobile robot.

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:28.029
Outside of engineering, the Kalman filter is very

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.820
popular in the field of economics, for instance,

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.619
to estimate the exchange rate of a particular currency or the global domestic product,

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:38.289
a measure of a country's economic well being.

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:41.604
Computer vision is another big user of the Kalman filter,

00:00:41.604 --> 00:00:45.329
for many different applications including feature tracking
