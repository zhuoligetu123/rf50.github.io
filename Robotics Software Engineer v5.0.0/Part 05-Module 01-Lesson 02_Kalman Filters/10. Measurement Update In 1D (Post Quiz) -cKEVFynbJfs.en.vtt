00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.410
The new Belief would have a mean somewhere in between the two Gaussians

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.517
since it combining information from both of them, but where?

00:00:07.517 --> 00:00:08.879
What do you think?

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.530
Would it lie precisely in the middle,

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:13.094
or would it lie closer to one of the curves?

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:16.155
Well, since the measurement update is more certain,

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:19.000
the new mean will lie closer to the measurement update.
