00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
The Kalman filter was invented by Rudolf Kalman,

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.655
at a very convenient time in American history.

00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:07.680
Soon after developing the algorithm,

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.270
Kalman visited his acquaintance,

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.745
Stanley Schmidt at his workplace at NASA and introduced the algorithm to NASA staff.

00:00:14.745 --> 00:00:18.960
At the time, NASA was struggling to apply existing algorithms to

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.510
the nonlinear problem of trajectory estimation for the Apollo program.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.675
The hope was to launch a spacecraft into a trajectory around the moon.

00:00:27.675 --> 00:00:30.750
The challenge lay in being able to create something accurate

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.720
enough to guide the spacecraft through very narrow quarters of space,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.790
but also efficient enough to run on an on-board computer in the 1960s.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.670
At the time, computing power was very limited in

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.505
both the on-board computer and the computer that was used for simulation and testing.

00:00:48.505 --> 00:00:51.860
Another challenge was that during the flight of the spacecraft,

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.625
measurements would be coming in at irregular time intervals,

00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:59.410
something that the existing algorithms were unable to process.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.020
After a lot of work and even some tweaking of the algorithm,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.480
the Kalman filter provided the Apollo mission with

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.140
a navigational accuracy to successfully enter orbit around the moon.
