00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.530
So far, I've been referring to the Kalman filter as one unique entity.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.095
However, they're actually three common types.

00:00:07.094 --> 00:00:10.994
There is a standard Kalman filter and there are two variations to it,

00:00:10.994 --> 00:00:14.504
the extended Kalman filter and the unscented Kalman filter.

00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:17.678
The Kalman filter can be applied to linear systems,

00:00:17.678 --> 00:00:20.580
ones where the output is proportional to the input.

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:25.814
The EKF can be applied to non-linear systems which is more applicable in robotics,

00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:29.585
as real-world systems are more often non-linear than linear.

00:00:29.585 --> 00:00:33.850
The UKF is another type of non-linear estimator appropriate for

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.140
highly non-linear systems where EKF may fail to converge.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.149
In this lesson, you'll be learning about

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.655
the Kalman filter and the extended Kalman filter.

00:00:42.655 --> 00:00:45.265
If you wish to learn about the unscented Kalman filter,

00:00:45.265 --> 00:00:47.755
you will find some helpful resources provided.

00:00:47.755 --> 00:00:50.600
Feel free to keep these for future reference.
