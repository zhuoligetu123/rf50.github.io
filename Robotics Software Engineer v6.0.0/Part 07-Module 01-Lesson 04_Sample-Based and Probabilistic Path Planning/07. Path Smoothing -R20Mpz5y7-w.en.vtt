00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.054
When you look at the paths produced by PRM and RRT,

00:00:04.054 --> 00:00:07.334
thereby no means optimal and can be quite jerky.

00:00:07.334 --> 00:00:09.839
Instead of using these paths directly,

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:14.684
some post-processing can be applied to smooth out the paths and improve the results.

00:00:14.683 --> 00:00:17.039
One simple algorithm that can be used,

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.589
is often referred to as a path shortcutter.

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.530
It looks for ways to shorten the resulting path,

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.545
by connecting two non-neighboring nodes together.

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:29.360
If it is able to find a pair of nodes whose edge is collision free,

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.155
then the original path between the two nodes is replaced with the shortcut edge.

00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:36.600
If this process is successful,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.030
then a search algorithm like A star search can

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.910
be applied to find the path from start to goal.

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:44.294
The resultant path may not be optimal,

00:00:44.295 --> 00:00:48.270
but it proves that moving from start to goal, is feasible.
