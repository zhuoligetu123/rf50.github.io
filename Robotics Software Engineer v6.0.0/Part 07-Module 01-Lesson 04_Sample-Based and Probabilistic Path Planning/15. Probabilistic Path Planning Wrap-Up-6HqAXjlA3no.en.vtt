00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.879
Great, you've seen how Markov decision processes can be applied to path planning,

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:06.355
to generate a policy,

00:00:06.355 --> 00:00:11.115
and how the policy can be used to guide the rover from any state to the goal.

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:13.830
You've learned about the value iteration algorithm

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.125
that is able to find the optimal policy,

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:19.679
and now you're ready to put an algorithm into action.
