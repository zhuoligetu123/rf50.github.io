00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
This concludes our discussion of sample-based path planning.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.985
As you saw in the previous few concepts

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:09.960
probabilistic roadmaps and rapidly exploring random trees are

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.990
two alternate algorithms for path planning which are

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.635
especially applicable in large high-dimensional spaces.

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:19.020
Although the algorithms are not complete,

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.765
they are considered to be probabilistically complete.

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:26.024
As their completeness grows exponentially with the number of samples collected.

00:00:26.024 --> 00:00:31.599
The algorithms that you learned here are incredibly applicable in real world robotics.
