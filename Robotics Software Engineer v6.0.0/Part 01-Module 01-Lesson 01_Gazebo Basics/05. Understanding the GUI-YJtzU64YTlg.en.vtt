00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
Now that you are familiar with Gazebo components,

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.150
let's move forward and understand the GUI.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.030
First, we will launch Gazebo from the terminal by typing in Gazebo.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.769
Once it has loaded completely,

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:18.629
you should see something like this.

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:24.015
The Gazebo GUI is divided into four major sections: the scene,

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:28.935
the site panel, the toolbars, and the menu.

00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:33.089
The scene is where you will be spending most of your time,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.290
whether you're creating assimilation or running one.

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:39.174
While you can use a trackpad to navigate inside the scene,

00:00:39.174 --> 00:00:41.209
a mouse is highly recommended.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.829
You can bend the scene by pressing and dragging the left mouse button.

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:47.585
In addition to that,

00:00:47.585 --> 00:00:49.640
if you hold down the Shift key,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.314
you can also rotate the view.

00:00:52.314 --> 00:00:56.479
You can zoom in or out by using the mouse scroll,

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:01.294
or by pressing and dragging the right mouse button.

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:04.579
Next, we have a toolbar at the top.

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:09.259
This toolbar provides quick access to some of the cursor modes,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.975
geometric shapes, and views.

00:01:11.974 --> 00:01:13.909
Let's look through your options.

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.984
Simple shapes, you can insert basic 3D models like cubes,

00:01:19.984 --> 00:01:26.234
spheres, or cylinders into the scene.

00:01:26.234 --> 00:01:29.540
Select mode, this is

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.465
the most commonly used cursor mode and this one allows you to navigate the scene.

00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:37.415
Translate mode,

00:01:37.415 --> 00:01:43.219
the translate mode cursor allows you to change the position of any model in the scene.

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:45.745
Simply select the cursor mode,

00:01:45.745 --> 00:01:52.079
and then use the proper axis to drag the object around, until you're satisfied.

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.739
Rotate mode, similar to the translation mode,

00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:02.729
this cursor mode allows you to change the orientation of any given model.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.640
Scale mode, this mode allows you to change

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.335
the scale and hence the overall size of any model.

00:02:12.335 --> 00:02:19.205
Lights, you can also add different light source like a spotlight,

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:24.525
point light, or directional light to the scene.

00:02:24.525 --> 00:02:31.969
View change, this tool lets you view the scene from different perspectives like top view,

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:37.134
side view, front view, or bottom view.

00:02:37.134 --> 00:02:42.949
You can also press the Home button to return to the home position of the camera.

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:49.579
The left panel has three different tabs: World, Insert, and Layers.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.325
The World tab displays all the lights and models currently in the scene.

00:02:55.324 --> 00:02:57.964
By clicking on any individual model,

00:02:57.965 --> 00:03:00.889
you can view or edit its basic properties,

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:05.145
like position and orientation.

00:03:05.145 --> 00:03:09.650
You can also change some of the physics properties of the scene like

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.164
gravity or magnetic field via the physics option.

00:03:14.164 --> 00:03:17.120
Insert tab, this is where you will find

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.000
all the objects and models to be added to the scene.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.159
You can left click to expand or collapse a list of models.

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:27.479
To place an object in the scene,

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:29.994
left-click the object of interest.

00:03:29.995 --> 00:03:33.085
This will bind the object to your mouse cursor.

00:03:33.085 --> 00:03:36.099
Now, you can place it anywhere in the scene

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.460
by cleft-clicking it again at your desired location.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.210
Layers, this is an optional feature.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.085
This tab will be empty in most cases.

00:03:47.085 --> 00:03:49.050
To learn more about the layers,

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.400
check out the link in the description below.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.960
Bottom toolbar, the bottom toolbar has a neat,

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.570
play and pause button.

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:06.340
This button allows you to pause the simulation and conveniently move objects around.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.319
This toolbar also displays data about the simulation,

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:17.800
such as the simulation time,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.235
the real-time, and the relationship between the two.

00:04:22.235 --> 00:04:26.270
There is also a frame per second counter that

00:04:26.269 --> 00:04:30.799
can be found to go to your system performance for any given scene.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.579
The menu, some of the menu options are duplicated in the toolbars,

00:04:36.579 --> 00:04:41.334
or as right-click contents menu options in the scene.

00:04:41.334 --> 00:04:43.750
If you click on Edit,

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.644
you can switch to the Building Editor to design buildings,

00:04:47.644 --> 00:04:51.420
or the Model Editor to build models.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.319
We will be working with both of these features in the upcoming concepts.

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:00.084
All right. Now that you've understood the Gazebo GUI,

00:05:00.084 --> 00:05:03.959
let's move on and simulate our first robot.
