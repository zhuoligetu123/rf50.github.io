00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.895
Welcome to the gazebo basics lesson.

00:00:02.895 --> 00:00:07.685
Here you will get hands-on experience with a three-dimensional robotics simulator.

00:00:07.684 --> 00:00:12.000
Robotic simulators allow you to model a 3D simulated version

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.289
of your surroundings and real-world robot with exact same physics.

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.324
You can also add sensors to the virtual robot, interact with it,

00:00:20.324 --> 00:00:23.369
activate its joints and so much more,

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.144
almost the same as working with the real-world robot.

00:00:26.144 --> 00:00:31.050
The big advantage of working in a simulator is saving both time and cost.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.410
As an engineer, you don't always want to be testing your code on

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:38.849
a real robot and then crashing it and spending time fixing it.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.645
Instead, you want to test your code in a simulator where mistakes are far less costly.

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:46.130
With a single key press,

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.445
you can reset your simulated robot to its initial state.

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:52.249
After intensive testing your code in simulator,

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:56.005
you can deploy the final version of your code on a real robot.

00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:58.340
One of the most common 3D physics

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.240
based simulators using the robotics word is called gazebo.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.629
Engineers are extensively using gazebo to test

00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:10.015
their software in simulation before they deploy it on the real world robot.

00:01:10.015 --> 00:01:15.305
In this lesson, you will learn the basics of gazebo to simulate the robotic environment.

00:01:15.305 --> 00:01:20.405
First, you'll get the basic understanding of the gazebo simulator and its features.

00:01:20.405 --> 00:01:23.510
Throughout the lesson, you will be able to practice working with

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.570
gazebo through the Udacity workspace that runs in your browser.

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:31.189
Then, you will learn the main components of the simulator.

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.230
Next, we'll take a look inside

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.969
gazebo so that you can understand this graphical user interface.

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.120
You will then simulate your first robot in the modulator.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.329
To interact with your simulated world,

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:45.295
you'll learn how to write plug-ins.

00:01:45.295 --> 00:01:50.105
Finally, you will explore the building editor to design a building in gazebo.

00:01:50.105 --> 00:01:53.079
All right now, let's get started.
