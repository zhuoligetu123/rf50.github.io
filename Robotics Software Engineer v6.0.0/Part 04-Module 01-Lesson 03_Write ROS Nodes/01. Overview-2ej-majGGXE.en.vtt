00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
Now that you've created a Catkin workspace,

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.250
and added the simple R package to it,

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.275
you are ready to write some RA's nodes.

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:13.260
In this lesson, you'll write RA's nodes in C++ that publish and subscribe to topics.

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.859
You'll also write the RA's service that can be called from a client node,

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.480
or from the command line.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.975
The first node that you'll be writing is called simple mover.

00:00:21.975 --> 00:00:24.720
The simple mover node does nothing more than

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:27.449
published joint angle commands to simple arm.

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.585
Once you've understand the general structure of a RA's node,

00:00:30.585 --> 00:00:33.465
you write a second node called R-mover.

00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:37.100
The R-mover node provides a service called safe move,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.200
which allows the R to be move to

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.190
any position within its workspace that has proven to be safe.

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:47.390
The safe zone is bounded by minimum and the maximum joint angles,

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.390
and it's configurable via the RA's parameter server.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.579
The last and third node you write in this lesson is the look away node.

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.019
This node subscribes to the aren't

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.175
joint positions and a topic where camera data is being published.

00:01:01.174 --> 00:01:05.030
When the camera detects an image with uniform color, meaning,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.135
that it's looking at the sky and the ARM is not moving,

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:10.550
then what we'll call the safe move service via

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.144
a client to move the ARM to a new position.

00:01:13.144 --> 00:01:14.614
With these new skills,

00:01:14.614 --> 00:01:19.000
you'd have everything you need as I call the upcoming projects in this program
