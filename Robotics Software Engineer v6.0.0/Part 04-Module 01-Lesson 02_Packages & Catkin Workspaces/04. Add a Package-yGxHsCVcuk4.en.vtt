00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
One of the biggest benefits of using Ross,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.879
is that it has a large community of users and

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.169
developers who have already created a lot of code that you can reuse.

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:15.030
Let's clone an existing package and add it to our newly created workspace.

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:20.559
Start by navigating to the source directory of your catkin workspace.

00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:28.214
Then use Git to clone the simple arm package for this lesson from this GitHub repo.

00:00:28.214 --> 00:00:34.604
Don't worry about trying to pause the video to copy the URL that I have shown here,

00:00:34.604 --> 00:00:37.724
as it's provided in the text module below.

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:40.289
After the repo has finished cloning,

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:45.134
you can change directory to the top level of the Ross workspace,

00:00:45.134 --> 00:00:50.379
and build a new package using the command catkin make.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.700
Looks like the build worked. That was easy.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.440
Now, we can run some code from the package that we just cloned.
