00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
Congratulations! You now have the experience of creating catkin workspaces,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.810
working with packages, dependencies and troubleshooting build errors.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.169
In the next lesson, you'll write additional ROS nodes for

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:17.054
the simple ARM package that you've already added to your catkin workspace.

00:00:17.054 --> 00:00:19.710
Before you actually begin writing ROS nodes,

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.690
make sure to take a peek at the links in

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.185
the official ROS Wiki Documentation regarding these topics.

00:00:25.184 --> 00:00:28.169
The documentation is an extremely useful resource for

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.439
us developers and will be valuable to you throughout the rest of the program.
