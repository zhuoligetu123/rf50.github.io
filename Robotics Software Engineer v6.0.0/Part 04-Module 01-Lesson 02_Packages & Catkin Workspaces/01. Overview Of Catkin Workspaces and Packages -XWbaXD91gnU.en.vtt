00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
Welcome back, ROS provides a powerful build and package management system called Catkin.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.019
Willow Garage the early developers of ROS named

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.099
Catkin after the flowers on the Willow trees surrounding their office.

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.789
A Catkin workspace is essentially a directory where

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.155
Catkin packages are both modified and installed.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:25.935
Typically, when you develop a ROS-based robot or project,

00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:28.064
you work out of a single workspace.

00:00:28.065 --> 00:00:32.539
This singular workspace will hold a wide variety of Catkin packages.

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:38.869
All ROS software components are organized into and distributed as Catkin packages.

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:42.109
Similar to workspaces, Catkin packages are nothing

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:45.545
more than directories containing a variety of resources.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.829
Catkin packages can contain source code for nodes,

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.894
useful scripts, configuration files, and more.

00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:54.835
In the section that follow,

00:00:54.835 --> 00:00:57.335
you see how to create a Catkin workspace,

00:00:57.335 --> 00:00:59.914
add packages to the Catkin workspace,

00:00:59.914 --> 00:01:04.969
manage inter-package dependencies, how to successfully compile everything,

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:09.179
and lastly, how to use launch files to run nodes.
