Michael did a great job in his interview,

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.519
actually he did a really good job of kind of highlighting the problem,

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:08.414
explaining the problem, and taking me through it step-by-step.

00:00:08.414 --> 00:00:13.169
I even asked him a couple of questions in his process of going through this problem,

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:15.500
and that allowed him to kind of stop and explain that,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.905
and kind of break his train of thought.

00:00:16.905 --> 00:00:20.670
Things I like to see is if somebody can actually go through and explain something

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.320
when they have their thought broken because

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.570
sometimes people might try to rehearse something,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.260
and not really understand it very well.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.460
But it really showed that Michael had really good knowledge in the area,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.825
and understood where he could go to make improvements.

00:00:31.824 --> 00:00:34.899
Michael also showed a great depth of knowledge in the area,

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:37.405
and seemed to be really interested in what he was talking about.

00:00:37.405 --> 00:00:41.160
I think he did a really good job explaining the Convolutional Neural Net,

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:44.559
and explaining how the encoding and decoding works.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.230
It was really great to see how

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:49.199
all this passion and excitement come through during his interview.
