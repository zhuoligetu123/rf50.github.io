00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
Vienna very quickly identified that

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.714
a Kalman filter would be a great application for sensor fusion.

00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:08.910
That's definitely something that I would expect us to use in

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.509
her actual job role so it's great

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:12.419
that that was the first thing that popped into her mind,

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:13.914
and she explained it well.

00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:16.469
Going forward from there, it was okay that she didn't know

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:18.739
exactly what she would do with different refresh rates.

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:21.125
It's not something, unless you've done a lot of hands on work,

00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:23.274
that you necessarily have the experience with.

00:00:23.274 --> 00:00:25.829
It's good that she didn't necessarily just try to come up

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.609
with a completely random answer that didn't really apply here.

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.609
So, it was great that when we got into the camera data,

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.644
she definitely identified that camera data would be important for our application,

00:00:35.645 --> 00:00:37.955
that having more data of different types

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:40.799
only can become better for your perception system,

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:43.954
and it's important to know that that should be something we should include.

00:00:43.954 --> 00:00:45.979
After that, again, we got into some of

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.409
the hands-on type of thing whether she'd worked in this yet,

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:49.839
but a lot of people don't have it.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.300
It was something that we considered nice to have beforehand,

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:54.994
and it's not something that we're going to

00:00:54.994 --> 00:00:57.239
necessarily count off for if they don't have that yet.
