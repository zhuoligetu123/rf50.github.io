00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.549
Overall, I thought Mike did fairly well.

00:00:02.549 --> 00:00:05.699
He went through and told me about how satellites work correctly,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.919
and also ascertain that you would need more than

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.789
just a single satellite to be able to localize position correctly.

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:15.269
He also was right in knowing that in robotics applications,

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.100
especially for a self-driving car,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.960
the amount of distance that GPS is accurate to is not always sufficient.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.835
He also was very helpful in coming up with correct applications that you could use in

00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:29.355
robotics or self-driving cars such a particle filter

00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:32.160
and the fact that he had worked on this before,

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.649
that show me that he would be a good fit for this position.

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.539
One thing I would say that he could do is

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:39.700
perhaps diagram this out for me a little bit more clearly,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.040
but other than that, I thought he gave a sufficient answer.
