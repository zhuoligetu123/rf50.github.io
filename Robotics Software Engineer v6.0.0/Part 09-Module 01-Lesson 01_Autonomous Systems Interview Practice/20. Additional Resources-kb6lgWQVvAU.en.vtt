00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.214
Nice work watching and reflecting on each of the interviews.

00:00:03.214 --> 00:00:05.355
We hope you gained some valuable insight

00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:07.975
into how to approach some of these types of questions.

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:10.080
Below this video, we've included

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.880
some additional resources for you to use in

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.304
preparing for your autonomous systems interview.

00:00:14.304 --> 00:00:16.980
Some are focused on building up your skills,

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.635
some typical programming problems you'll solve.

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:21.270
We suggest to do them in

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.745
the programming language you'll need for the jobs you want to apply for.

00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:27.144
Again, for autonomous systems roles,

00:00:27.144 --> 00:00:29.524
this typically means C++.

00:00:29.524 --> 00:00:33.229
We also have linked some resources to help you build up your knowledge of

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:37.509
data structures and algorithms including runtime and complexity as well.

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:42.958
Again, make sure you refresh yourself on any topics listed in job responsibilities,

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:46.930
minimum requirements, or if you've put something on your resume.

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:49.560
For instance, if the job description mentioned

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.230
systems architect and real time operating systems,

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.314
you should make sure you feel comfortable in those areas.

00:00:55.314 --> 00:00:59.239
Of course, don't forget to research the company itself.
