Aaron did a great job in is deep learning interview.

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.349
He went through and clearly stated

00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:07.070
what all made up semantic segmentation and how it works.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.544
He did a very good job in going through the technical nature

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:14.804
of a neural network and explaining the encoder to decoder network,

00:00:14.804 --> 00:00:16.920
and especially when he started getting into

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.550
his loss functions which are extremely important for semantic segmentation.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.160
It was clear that he knew what he was talking about.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.300
One of the things I would probably ask Aaron to do, otherwise,

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.080
is maybe to even code a little bit of his neural network perhaps in TensorFlow or Keras,

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.835
just to show his knowledge of those deep learning libraries.

00:00:33.835 --> 00:00:36.350
Other than that, though, I really liked Aaron's answer.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.960
He showed his technical knowledge really well,
