00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.745
There's one area we should circle back on,

00:00:02.745 --> 00:00:04.765
learning about the company itself.

00:00:04.764 --> 00:00:07.080
It's extremely important to research

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.949
the company you're interviewing with before your interview.

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:11.704
As we mentioned before,

00:00:11.705 --> 00:00:14.910
you'll likely get asked about why you want to work for the company,

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.940
but you are also likely to get asked about what you know about the company's products,

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.990
especially in the area you would be working in.

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:24.974
Near the end of the interview,

00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:27.630
you could also utilize the information you've researched,

00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:30.119
they'll come up with detailed questions for the interviewer

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.925
themselves in order to avoid asking generic questions.

00:00:33.924 --> 00:00:37.519
Let's take a quick look back in the job posting from before.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.220
One of the first things to know about how a company

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.304
describes itself is in its commitment to community.

00:00:43.304 --> 00:00:45.530
This would indicate to me that I should check out

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.005
some of their community initiatives they do.

00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:52.484
The next paragraph discusses more about their focus on transportation.

00:00:52.484 --> 00:00:57.304
Note that this is broader than the most common area they're known for in ride-sharing.

00:00:57.304 --> 00:01:00.259
Know who they consider themselves competitors with.

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:03.589
Realizing that they are about mobility and transportation as

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.835
a whole means there is a wide range of companies they see as competitors,

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:10.169
as opposed to what you might expect.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.555
This is not included in the job description,

00:01:12.555 --> 00:01:14.415
but while this course was being developed,

00:01:14.415 --> 00:01:15.770
Lyft had recently acquired

00:01:15.769 --> 00:01:19.719
a bike-sharing company and had announced plans around scooter-sharing as well.

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:24.224
That was fairly easy to gather from some research of press releases, news,

00:01:24.224 --> 00:01:27.199
and blog posts, but it's important way to show that

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.640
you're knowledgeable about and care about the company.
