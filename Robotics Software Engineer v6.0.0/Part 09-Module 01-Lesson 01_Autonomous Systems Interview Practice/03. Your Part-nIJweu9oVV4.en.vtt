00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.040
After watching and reflecting on the example interviews, it'll be your turn.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.134
You'll get a chance to choose questions from an area of your interest,

00:00:08.134 --> 00:00:10.879
like deep learning engineer or controls engineer,

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.320
and answer a few questions for that role.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.960
Along with the more role-specific questions,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.950
you'll also be asked to respond to a question about a recent project you've worked on,

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.274
to help show your expertise and passion in that area.

00:00:23.274 --> 00:00:26.199
This can be a deceptively important question.

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.929
Can you articulate why you chose this project?

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.140
What steps along with missteps you took along the way,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.049
why the end result was interesting,

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:37.339
and potentially, even what you'd do to further improve it?

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.310
Now, before we get started on the interviews.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.650
Let's talk through a few more important areas to

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.759
consider for interviews in autonomous systems.
