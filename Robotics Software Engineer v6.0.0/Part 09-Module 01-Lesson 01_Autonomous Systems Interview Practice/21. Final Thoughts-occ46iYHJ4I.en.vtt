00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.009
Now, it's your turn.

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:05.400
You're going to get the chance to practice some additional questions yourself.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.155
They're similar to those you may be asked in an autonomous systems interview.

00:00:09.154 --> 00:00:13.384
Well, you split out the questions in a different job areas like the interviews were.

00:00:13.384 --> 00:00:16.019
While for the project, you only need to focus on

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:20.199
a specific area as well as discuss one of your own projects you've worked on.

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.204
Feel free to check out some of the questions in

00:00:22.204 --> 00:00:24.979
other sections on your own traditional practice.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.355
Please remember that this list is not meant to be exhaustive.

00:00:28.355 --> 00:00:30.830
There are many, many more potential questions in

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.945
these areas that you could be asked during your interview.

00:00:33.945 --> 00:00:37.369
However, just like the interviews you watched before,

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:39.559
these are meant to be generally indicative of

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.075
the type and style of questions might be asked.

00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:46.910
As such, the questions are meant to help you think through how you

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:51.024
would approach questions of this style and practice, how to do so.

00:00:51.024 --> 00:00:52.699
In answering these questions,

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.790
make sure to add any code, drawings,

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.619
or diagrams you feel are necessary to explain yourself.

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:02.044
For the project, any code you write should be done in C++.

00:01:02.045 --> 00:01:04.025
While you go through your questions,

00:01:04.025 --> 00:01:06.185
there is one additional item to consider.

00:01:06.185 --> 00:01:11.015
You likely have not finished a topic just by answering the first question asked to be.

00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:12.650
After your initial answer,

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.055
your interviewer will likely follow-up on different items you mentioned,

00:01:16.055 --> 00:01:21.100
as well as probe deeper to see just how far your knowledge on a particular topic goes.

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:24.199
As such, you should build this into your responses in

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.195
your project as you answer what do you think some of the likely follow-ups are,

00:01:29.194 --> 00:01:33.319
how might you even go deeper than the initial question required.

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:35.649
You may run into things you don't know.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.115
If you're unfamiliar with the question in your area,

00:01:38.114 --> 00:01:40.254
go read up and learn about the topic.

00:01:40.254 --> 00:01:43.849
It's okay if you don't know every single item in here,

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:46.500
and it's fine to make part of this course a learning experience in

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.855
your area of interest as well as interview preparation.

00:01:49.855 --> 00:01:52.305
We encourage you to challenge yourself here.

00:01:52.305 --> 00:01:55.325
Don't just stick to questions you feel you can easily answer.

00:01:55.325 --> 00:02:00.055
You might even find a couple of items you want to work on to add to your portfolio.

00:02:00.055 --> 00:02:03.650
After the project, we hope you feel much more confident about

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.600
answering these types of questions and interviewing for autonomous systems positions.

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:10.060
Good luck in your job search.
