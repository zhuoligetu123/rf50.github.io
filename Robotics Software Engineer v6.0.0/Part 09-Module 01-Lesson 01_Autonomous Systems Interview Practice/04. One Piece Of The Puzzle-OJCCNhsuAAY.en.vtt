00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.475
When you're preparing for an interview in the field of autonomous systems,

00:00:03.475 --> 00:00:06.209
it's important to remember that the questions you'll consider in

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:09.105
this course are just one piece of the puzzle.

00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:14.324
Just as important, is the need to know data structures and algorithms and often C++.

00:00:14.324 --> 00:00:16.714
A typical interview in

00:00:16.714 --> 00:00:20.954
autonomous systems will likely include questions from both of these areas.

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:25.554
C++ is often crucial for these types of positions to the most applications,

00:00:25.554 --> 00:00:28.399
Mean Embedded Systems, limited resources.

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:32.894
A drone and even a car can only fit so much compute power on board.

00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:36.805
Latency would often be too high to rely on cloud compute here.

00:00:36.804 --> 00:00:40.820
Certain positions or companies may let you get by an only Python,

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.265
such as a role iterating and deep learning models but,

00:00:44.265 --> 00:00:47.730
if you work directly on a robot, you'll need C++.

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:51.049
We have a separate course for C++ technical interviews

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:54.929
as well as material or some useful data structures and algorithms to know.

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:57.965
You can find the lead in the instructor's notes below

00:00:57.965 --> 00:01:01.160
and we'll also have additional resources at the end of the course.
