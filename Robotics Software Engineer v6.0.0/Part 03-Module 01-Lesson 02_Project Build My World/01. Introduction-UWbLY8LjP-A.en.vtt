00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.714
Welcome to the build my word project.

00:00:02.714 --> 00:00:06.165
In this module, you'll learn how to create a Gazebo word,

00:00:06.165 --> 00:00:08.085
interact with it through plugins,

00:00:08.085 --> 00:00:10.905
and design models using Gazebo tools

00:00:10.904 --> 00:00:14.730
such as the moderator tool and the building editor tool.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.954
Now, you will utilize what you learn to build your own robotic simulated environment.

00:00:19.954 --> 00:00:22.909
In this project, you will design a Gazebo word,

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.259
use it as a simulation environment for all your upcoming projects.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.435
Specifically, you will use the building editor tool

00:00:30.434 --> 00:00:34.199
to design and build a sculpture to house your future robot.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.900
Furthermore, you would design an object using the moderator tool.

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.695
Then, you would include multiple instances of that object in your world.

00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:45.865
You will also import a model of

00:00:45.865 --> 00:00:50.280
the Gazebo online library and include it in your Gazebo word theme.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.960
To interact with your word,

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.020
you will write the word program to display

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.930
a welcome message for anyone visiting the word.

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:02.159
I hope you're excited to unleash your creativity and have fun working with Gazebo.
