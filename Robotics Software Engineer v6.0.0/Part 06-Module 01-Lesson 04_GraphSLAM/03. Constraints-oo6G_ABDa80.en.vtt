00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.509
One way to look at soft constraints is to interpret

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:07.455
them as masses connected by rubber bands or springs.

00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:10.155
When no external forces are acting on them,

00:00:10.154 --> 00:00:13.969
the springs will naturally bring the system into a configuration,

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.885
where the forces experienced by all of the springs are minimized.

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:21.660
When the nodes are connected in a linear function as so,

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.480
the resting configuration is easy to find,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.155
but the process becomes more challenging as nodes become more and more interconnected.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:35.215
The springs will all try to push or pull the system in their own ways.

00:00:35.215 --> 00:00:38.502
This is very similar to how constraints work in a graph.

00:00:38.502 --> 00:00:41.190
Every motion or measurement constraint pulls

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:44.414
a system closer to that constraints desired state.

00:00:44.414 --> 00:00:47.144
Since the measurement and motions are uncertain,

00:00:47.145 --> 00:00:52.225
constraints will conflict with each other and there will always be some error present.

00:00:52.225 --> 00:00:55.890
In the end, the goal is to find the node configuration that

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.000
minimizes the overall error present in all the constraints.
