Congratulations. In the first half of this lesson,

00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:05.445
you learned the fundamentals of graph SLAM,

00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:07.217
how a graph is constructed,

00:00:07.216 --> 00:00:08.968
how do we evaluate the constraints,

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.235
and how graph optimization is done.

00:00:11.233 --> 00:00:15.059
You also learned about a specialized SLAM approach, called RTAB-Map,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.820
the importance of loop closure and how the process is

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.820
optimized using bag of words, and memory management.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.274
We haven't fully deconstructed all of the algorithms of this complex SLAM approach,

00:00:25.274 --> 00:00:28.079
but this knowledge will take you forward and equip you to

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:31.829
utilize RTAB-Map as an advanced ROS package in your projects.

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.289
You've gone through a lot of difficult content in this lesson, and we're proud of you.

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:40.100
In fact, we feel that you deserve a puppy.
