00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
Congratulations on learning graph SLAM.

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.940
I found this algorithm quite challenging to learn.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.770
There's a fair bit of math to sift

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:11.099
through and there are a lot of intricacies to its operation.

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.698
If I were you, I would be proud of getting this far.

00:00:14.698 --> 00:00:16.649
Since the start of this lesson,

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:20.820
you've learned how to construct a graph of poses and features how to

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.185
define the constraints both in one-dimensional and multi-dimensional systems,

00:00:25.184 --> 00:00:28.169
and how to solve a system of equations to determine

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.255
the most likely set of poses given the observations.

00:00:32.255 --> 00:00:34.150
You then looked at how to handle

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.884
non-linear measurement in motion constraints by linearizing them,

00:00:37.884 --> 00:00:41.320
and how to solve a system of equations iteratively until

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.804
convergence to achieve the best results.

00:00:44.804 --> 00:00:48.010
That's a lot to cover in one lesson, but you did it.

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:53.349
Next, you'll be learning a specific graph-based SLAM approach called RTAB-Map.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.560
Erica will help you understand some practical applications of

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.950
RTAB-Map that will prepare you to implement it in future projects.
