00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.394
Now that you are familiar with the Gazebo word graphical user interface,

00:00:04.394 --> 00:00:06.224
let's simulate a robot.

00:00:06.224 --> 00:00:11.399
We will create these two wheeled robot using the model editor tool of Gazebo.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.820
A modelling Gazebo contains information about a single robot or object,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.670
and it can be easily included in a Word file.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.335
The reason for creating a model is to import

00:00:24.335 --> 00:00:30.725
multiple instances of it in a word or simply use it in other projects.

00:00:30.725 --> 00:00:34.100
First, create a directory to store

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.185
the model file as well as the Word file that includes the model file.

00:00:39.185 --> 00:00:45.780
Inside home workspace, create a new directory and name it "myrobot".

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.750
Then, navigate to "myrobot".

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:57.255
Inside this directory, create both a word directory and the model directory.

00:00:57.255 --> 00:01:00.995
Now that you have a place to store your model and Word files,

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:03.033
it's time to start Gazebo,

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:06.739
access the model editor tool and simulate the robot.

00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:13.530
To start Gazebo, type Gazebo in the terminal and wait for a few seconds.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.030
Here's the Gazebo word main interface.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.195
Since you'll want to first create the robot model and then include it in the word scene,

00:01:22.194 --> 00:01:24.375
switch to the model editor.

00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:30.135
To do that, click on "Edit" and then click on "Model Editor".

00:01:30.135 --> 00:01:35.015
By default, the simulation and the physics are both posed.

00:01:35.015 --> 00:01:38.390
The model editor interface looks very similar to

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.480
the Gazebo main word interface with slight differences.
