00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
Now, let's start constructing a two wheeled robot.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.669
For better visualization, you may wish to reorient the scene.

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:10.844
To create the chassis,

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:16.875
click on box and then drop it anywhere in the scene by releasing the mouse button.

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:21.945
By default, this box has a volume of one meter cube.

00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:24.629
To resemble the robot's main chassis,

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:27.884
you need to add it the box's dimensions.

00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:31.755
Also, you'll want to change the chassis initial position.

00:00:31.754 --> 00:00:36.810
You can always use the toolbar in gazebo to resize the box or change it's

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:42.410
position and orientation as you saw earlier in the gazebo main word gooey.

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:46.809
Now, to precisely edit the robot position and dimension,

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.045
double-click on the box.

00:00:49.045 --> 00:00:52.405
A link inspector window should pop up.

00:00:52.405 --> 00:00:56.169
Here, you can precisely edit the shape position,

00:00:56.168 --> 00:01:00.479
orientation, dimension and other properties.

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:06.390
For now, scroll down to the bottom of the list and change the box position to

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.950
zero, zero and 0.2.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.530
Then, once you have your box centered,

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.864
you'll want to edit its dimensions.

00:01:18.864 --> 00:01:20.500
Before you do that,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.739
let's take a moment and understand the difference between

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:29.099
an object's visual aspect and it's collision aspect.

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:32.419
A visual aspect of an object is it's

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.814
graphical representation and does not affect the physics simulation.

00:01:36.814 --> 00:01:39.679
On the other hand, a collision aspect of

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.555
an object is used by the physics engine for collision checking.

00:01:44.555 --> 00:01:47.465
Back to editing the box dimensions.

00:01:47.465 --> 00:01:51.185
First, to change the visual shape of your box,

00:01:51.185 --> 00:01:56.730
click on visual, expand the list and scroll down to geometry.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.200
In geometry, change the box size to 0.3,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.610
one and 0.1.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.900
You should now see a smaller box inside the bigger one.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.224
This is expected as you have only changed the visual geometry and not the collision one.

00:02:17.224 --> 00:02:20.044
Now, to change the collision size,

00:02:20.044 --> 00:02:25.264
click on collision, expand it and scroll down to geometry.

00:02:25.264 --> 00:02:27.334
As you did earlier in the visual,

00:02:27.335 --> 00:02:35.015
change the box size to 0.3, one and 0.1.

00:02:35.014 --> 00:02:37.194
Then hit okay.

00:02:37.194 --> 00:02:42.039
This box is now looking exactly like a two wheeled robot chassis.
