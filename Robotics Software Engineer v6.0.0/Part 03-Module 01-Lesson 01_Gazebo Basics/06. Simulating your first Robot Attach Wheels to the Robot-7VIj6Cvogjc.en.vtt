00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
You still have to couple the chassis with a wheel on

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.554
its left side and another one on its right side.

00:00:06.554 --> 00:00:11.445
To do that, select the cylinder and drop it anywhere in the scene.

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:16.500
Double click on the cylinder, scroll down,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.384
and change its z-coordinate to 0.2,

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:22.275
same as the box,

00:00:22.274 --> 00:00:26.589
and its orientation to 90 degrees.

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:34.500
Now, change the cylinder radius to 0.2 and its length to 0.1,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.630
both in visual and collision.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.180
Next, create a copy of the first wheel using

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:50.134
the toolbar menu and paste it on the other side of the chassis.

00:00:50.134 --> 00:00:54.849
The only remaining task is to connect the wheels through the chassis and

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.495
this is done by creating a revolute joint between the chassis and each wheel.

00:00:59.494 --> 00:01:03.259
The revolute joint will allow the wheel to spin.

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:06.379
In the toolbar, click on joints.

00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:10.079
By default the revolute joint is selected.

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:17.340
Now, select the chassis as the parent and the first wheel as the child.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.650
Next, choose the z-axis to be the axis

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.130
of rotation since the wheel should rotate with respect to this axis.

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:32.030
Lastly, align the wheel with the robot chassis.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.870
Select mid x and minimum y,

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:43.070
then reverse the y-coordinate so that the wheel stays on the outside of the chassis.

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:48.784
Next, create another joint to link the chassis with the second wheel.

00:01:48.784 --> 00:01:52.019
Same as before, click on joints,

00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:57.590
select the chassis as the parent and the second wheel as the child.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.719
Change the joint axis to z.

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.825
Select mid x and max y reversed.

00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:12.099
Here's your first two wheeled robot model simulated in Gazebo.

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.409
Now, save a copy of your model.

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:17.549
Click on File, Save as.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:27.860
Change the directory to the model directory created earlier and save the model as robot.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:35.860
Next, exit the model editor and go back to the main world scene of Gazebo.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.620
Your model should be automatically included in a world scene in gazebo.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.830
You can save this world that includes the model of your robot.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.180
Click File, Save world as.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.280
Change the directory to the world directory created

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:02.745
earlier and save this world as My world.

00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:08.855
Now, that you've built your first modeling gazebo and included it in an emptly world,

00:03:08.854 --> 00:03:14.399
practice building other robots and feel free to share them with your classmates.
