00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
In these examples, even though you have a list of topics,

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.940
some things are still unclear.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.780
For example, the rostopic list command does

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:14.234
not tell us which nodes are publishing or subscribing to a topic,

00:00:14.234 --> 00:00:17.024
or what type of messages are being passed.

00:00:17.024 --> 00:00:18.839
To get that information,

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:21.570
we will use the command rostopic info.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.310
Let's start with getting information about the command vel topic,

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:34.019
rostopic info, and then the name of the topic you'd like more information about.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.300
In this case, turtle1,

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:40.079
command vel. There you have it.

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.199
The command vel topic has one publisher,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.450
the teleop node, and one subscriber, the turtlesim node.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.640
This is as you might have suspected a while back when we

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.145
were using the keyboard to command the turtle vel teleop node.

00:00:57.145 --> 00:01:01.640
The message type associated with the command vel topic is

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.379
a twist message and is part of the geometry messages package.

00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:10.339
You might be asking yourself right now what is a twist message.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.620
To learn that, we will use the ros message command next.
