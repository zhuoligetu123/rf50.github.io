00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.024
Now that we've discussed topics,

00:00:02.024 --> 00:00:05.040
let's talk about the messages transmitted over them.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.745
ROS has a wide variety of predefined message types.

00:00:08.744 --> 00:00:14.369
There are messages types for communicating physical quantities such as positions,

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.899
velocities, accelerations, rotations, and duration.

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:24.659
There are also messages for communicating sensor readings such as laser scans,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.004
images, point clouds, and inertial measurements.

00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:32.744
The number of message types available in ROS is actually quite staggering.

00:00:32.744 --> 00:00:35.280
Doing a simple search on my system,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.804
I was able to count over 200 different message types.

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:42.210
However, even with so many useful message types,

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.590
there would still be times when you want to define your own.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.945
We'll tackle that later in this lesson.

00:00:47.945 --> 00:00:53.884
It's important to note that messages can contain any kind of data not just text.

00:00:53.884 --> 00:00:59.674
Here's an example of the message types associated with the topics we looked at earlier.

00:00:59.674 --> 00:01:03.663
In this case, the topic called camera_images transports

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:08.015
image messages from the camera node to the position estimator node.

00:01:08.015 --> 00:01:12.109
Similarly, the wheel_encoders topic transports

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:17.400
rotation messages from the wheel encoder node to the position estimator node.
