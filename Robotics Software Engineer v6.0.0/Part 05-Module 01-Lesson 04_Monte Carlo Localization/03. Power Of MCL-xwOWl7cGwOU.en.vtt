00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
With the extended Kalman Filter localization algorithm,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.794
you can estimate the pose of almost any robot with accurate onboard sensors.

00:00:07.794 --> 00:00:12.780
So, you might be wondering why it's necessary to master another localization algorithm.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:16.875
Well, MCL presents many advantages over EKF.

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:21.144
First, MCL is easy to program compared to EKF.

00:00:21.144 --> 00:00:24.519
You will be able to evaluate this by yourself while coding

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:28.364
MCL algorithm with C++ in the upcoming lesson.

00:00:28.364 --> 00:00:31.734
Second, MCL represents non-Gaussian distributions

00:00:31.734 --> 00:00:35.670
and can approximate any other practical important distribution.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.670
This means that MCL is unrestricted by

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.020
a linear Gaussian states-based assumption as is the case for EKF.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.320
This allows MCL to model a much greater variety of

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.630
environments especially since you can't

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.560
always model the real world with Gaussian distributions.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.790
Third, in MCL, you can control the computational memory and resolution of

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.920
your solution by changing the number of

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.049
particles distributed uniformly and randomly throughout the map.

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.774
This might not make sense to you yet,

00:01:05.775 --> 00:01:10.065
but you'll be able to understand it as we go through building the MCL and C++.

00:01:10.064 --> 00:01:12.736
