00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.444
Now that you've learned the Monte Carlo Localization algorithm,

00:00:03.444 --> 00:00:06.977
let's see the MCL apply to a one-dimensional hallway.

00:00:06.977 --> 00:00:11.849
In this hallway, the mobile robot can move upward and downward.

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.625
Also, the robot is capable of collecting

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:18.240
all the battery information and sensing the presence of doors.

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:21.119
Initially, at time T equal one,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.240
particles are drawn randomly and uniformly over the entire post space.

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:28.664
Then, at time T equal two,

00:00:28.664 --> 00:00:33.247
the robot senses a door and MCL assigns weights to each particle.

00:00:33.247 --> 00:00:35.954
The number of particles remains constant,

00:00:35.954 --> 00:00:39.359
whereas the particles' importance weights are adjusted.

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:41.021
Now, at time T equal three,

00:00:41.021 --> 00:00:45.539
the robot moves down the hallway and the particle set is shifted.

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.570
The new set has uniform importance weight and

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.951
the high number of particles near the three likely places.

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:54.645
Moving on at time T equal four,

00:00:54.645 --> 00:00:57.585
the robot senses another door and the new measurement

00:00:57.585 --> 00:01:01.210
assigns non-uniform importance weight to the particle set.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.704
Finally, at time T equal five,

00:01:03.704 --> 00:01:08.009
the robot keeps moving down the hallway causing a new particle set to generate.
