00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860
Congratulations. You just mastered the Monte Carlo Localization algorithm.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.555
By completing this lesson,

00:00:06.554 --> 00:00:11.370
you are now experienced in the two most common localization algorithms in robotics.

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:14.594
As of now, you're probably anxious to localize robots

00:00:14.595 --> 00:00:18.015
in the real world using EKF or MCL algorithms,

00:00:18.015 --> 00:00:23.920
but before you jump in, let's code the MCL algorithm using C++ in the upcoming lesson.
