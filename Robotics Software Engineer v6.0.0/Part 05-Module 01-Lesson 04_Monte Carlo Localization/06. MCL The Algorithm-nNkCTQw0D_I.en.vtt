00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.089
The Monte Carlo Localization Algorithm is

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:07.479
composed of two main sections represented by two for loops.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.190
The first section is the motion and sensor update,

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:13.429
and the second one is the resampling process.

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:15.240
Given a map of the environment,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.289
the goal of the MCL is to determine the robot's pose represented by the belief.

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.464
At each iteration, the algorithm takes the previous belief,

00:00:24.464 --> 00:00:29.250
the actuation command, and the sensor measurements as input.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.704
Initially, the belief is obtained by randomly generating m particles.

00:00:33.704 --> 00:00:35.699
Then, in the first for loop,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.570
the hypothetical state is computed whenever the robot moves.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.880
Following, the particles weight is computed using the latest sensor measurements.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.090
Now, motion and measurement are both added to the previous state.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.660
Moving onto the second section of the MCL where a sampling process happens.

00:00:54.659 --> 00:01:00.539
Here, the particles with high probability survive and are re-drawn in the next iteration,

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.369
while the others die.

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:06.989
Finally, the algorithm outputs the new belief and another cycle of

00:01:06.989 --> 00:01:12.000
iteration starts implementing the next motion by reading the new sensor measurements.
