00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.685
Now, it's time to cover another famous localization algorithm.

00:00:03.685 --> 00:00:06.314
In this lesson, you will learn the Monte Carlo or MCL.

00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:08.850
We'll discuss the advantages of

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.910
Monte Carlo over the Extended Kalman Filter in localizing robots.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.460
And then, you will learn the role of Particle Filters in the MCL algorithm.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.570
Moving on, you will learn

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.240
the Bayes Filter algorithm and you will evaluate the information state or belief.

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.579
After that, you will learn the Monte Carlo Localization Pseudo Code.

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.074
By the end of the lesson,

00:00:28.074 --> 00:00:31.804
you will see how MCL can be applied to a robot to estimate its pose.

00:00:31.804 --> 00:00:33.840
Before we dive deeper into MCL,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.005
check the reference paper by Sebastian Throne.

00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:38.790
The first section of this paper will be especially helpful to

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:41.460
you as it describes the localization challenges,

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.435
followed by a detailed explanation of MCL.

00:00:44.435 --> 00:00:47.000
All right now, let's dive in.
