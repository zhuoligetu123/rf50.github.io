00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.454
If we look at our company right now,

00:00:07.453 --> 00:00:10.212
there are a handful of people who focus on the business side;

00:00:10.212 --> 00:00:12.219
so the sales, the marketing,

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.144
the legal, those aspects of it.

00:00:14.144 --> 00:00:17.320
And we found a lot of people who have particular expertise

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.030
whether it's in technology or writing or as a nurse,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.449
or as a lawyer or whatever it might be.

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.071
But who have a passion for the problem that we're trying to solve,

00:00:25.071 --> 00:00:28.875
which is helping chronic care patients get better care over time.

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:33.070
And so what that means is if you look at the resumes and the backgrounds,

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.795
or the LinkedIn profiles of people,

00:00:34.795 --> 00:00:36.789
it's a really diverse group.

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:39.115
But if you look at what people are focused on,

00:00:39.115 --> 00:00:40.765
then it's a very cohesive group.

00:00:40.765 --> 00:00:41.950
I think that people with

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.299
good strong software backgrounds is more important than specifically what it is.

00:00:46.298 --> 00:00:49.353
So get good at anything,

00:00:49.353 --> 00:00:52.235
and then figure out where you want to apply that.

00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:56.209
With robotics as an industry taking off more and more,

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.405
you see companies like ours and many others hiring more and more people with

00:01:00.405 --> 00:01:05.989
strong skill sets at the intersection of robotics and something else.

00:01:05.989 --> 00:01:09.909
Find what you are good at and what you enjoy doing and figure out how you apply that.

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.609
So, I think what we see is again,

00:01:12.608 --> 00:01:15.843
robotics in general is being applied in so many different industries.

00:01:15.843 --> 00:01:17.933
Obviously we're talking about health care here again,

00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:22.060
and some of the things that that draws upon in terms of skill sets.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.379
You can see an overlap with almost any skill set being brought to

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:31.909
the table for interesting robotics applications now in industry.
