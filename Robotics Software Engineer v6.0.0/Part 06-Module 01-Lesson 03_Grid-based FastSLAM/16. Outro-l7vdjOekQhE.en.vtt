00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.575
Congratulations. You've done a fantastic job by completing this lesson.

00:00:04.575 --> 00:00:08.929
You've learned the two essential key features of the SLAM problem.

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.279
The first feature lies in two forms,

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.564
which are the OnlineSLAM and the FootSLAM problem.

00:00:14.564 --> 00:00:20.369
The second feature to the SLAM problem is related to its continuous discrete nature.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.143
Then, you were exposed to the challenges of SLAM.

00:00:23.143 --> 00:00:25.630
The continuous nature of the SLAM problem

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:28.980
posed a big challenge because of the high dimension of posterior.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.390
In addition, the discrete nature of the SLAM problem poses

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.835
another challenge because of a large number of correspondence values that exists.

00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:42.670
Moving on, you were introduced to the FastSLAM algorithm.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.579
We choose the particle filter approach along with

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:51.009
a low-dimensional extended Kalman filter estimation to solve the SLAM problem.

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:54.379
You've also learned how to overcome some drawbacks to

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.315
the FastSLAM algorithm by adapting it to grid

00:00:57.314 --> 00:01:00.754
maps which resulted in the grid based FastSLAM algorithm.

00:01:00.755 --> 00:01:04.180
You saw how the grid based FastSLAM algorithm implements part of

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.145
the MCL algorithm along with the occupancy grid mapping algorithm.

00:01:08.144 --> 00:01:11.454
And finally, you've moved to simulation where you implemented

00:01:11.454 --> 00:01:14.079
a G-mapping ROS package based on the grid

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:18.140
based FastSLAM algorithm to map the environment and estimate the robot path.

00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:20.045
That's it for now.

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:23.000
Stay tuned for another SLAM algorithm in the upcoming lesson.
