00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.609
Adapting the Fast SLAM algorithm to

00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:06.089
grid maps is altered in the grid-based Fast SLAM algorithm.

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.480
Since the grid-based Fast SLAM algorithm uses

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.995
a particle filter approach and represents the world in terms of grid maps,

00:00:13.994 --> 00:00:16.634
we will need to combine what we learned from

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:19.970
MCL and the Occupancy Grid Mapping algorithm.

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:23.919
Now, we will need three different techniques represented by

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.895
three probability functions to adapt fast SLAM to grid mapping.

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:31.600
These techniques are known as the sampling motion,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.960
map estimation, and the importance weight.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.813
Starting with the sampling motion technique.

00:00:37.813 --> 00:00:41.200
This technique estimates the current pose giving

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.700
the K-th particle previous pose and the current controls you.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.000
The map estimation technique objective is to

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.164
estimate the current map giving the current measurements,

00:00:52.164 --> 00:00:54.445
the current K-th particle pose,

00:00:54.445 --> 00:00:57.085
and the previous K-th particle map.

00:00:57.085 --> 00:00:59.859
Looking closely at this probability function,

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:04.900
we can relate it to the mapping problem in which we aim to estimate the map,

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.940
giving the robot's trajectory.

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:09.700
So, to solve the map estimation problem,

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.715
we can rely on the Occupancy Grid Mapping algorithm.

00:01:12.715 --> 00:01:16.060
And finally, there is the importance weight technique

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.379
which computes the importance weight of each individual particle.

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:24.984
This method estimates the current likelihood of the measurement

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:30.799
giving the current K-th particle pose and the current K-th particle map.
