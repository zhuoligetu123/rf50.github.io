00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.469
Welcome back. You are now going to tackle a much more challenging problem of

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:09.375
estimating both the map and the robot poses in real-world environments.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:14.190
This problem is called Simultaneous Localization and Mapping or SLAM.

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:20.519
Some roboticists referred to it as CLAM or Concurrent Localization and Mapping.

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.144
While solving localization problems,

00:00:23.144 --> 00:00:26.759
you assume they know enough and estimate the robot poses.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.535
Whereas, in solving mapping problems,

00:00:29.535 --> 00:00:34.469
you are provided with the exact robot poses and estimated the map of the environment.

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.619
Now, you will combine your knowledge from

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:43.664
both localization and mapping to solve the most fundamental problem in robotics.

00:00:43.664 --> 00:00:46.588
In SLAM, you will map the environment,

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:49.590
giving the noisy measurements and localize robot

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.904
relative to its own map giving the controls.

00:00:52.904 --> 00:00:56.790
This makes it a much more difficult problem than localization or

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.954
mapping since both the map and the poses are now unknown to you.

00:01:02.954 --> 00:01:06.480
In real-world environments, you will primarily be faced with

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.025
SLAM problems and you will aim to estimate the map and localize the robot.

00:01:11.025 --> 00:01:14.370
An example of a robot solving its SLAM problem is

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.150
robotic vacuum cleaner that uses the measurements provided by

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.120
its laser finder sensors and data from

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.454
the encoders to estimate the map and localize itself relative to it.

00:01:25.454 --> 00:01:28.209
All right now, let's get started.
