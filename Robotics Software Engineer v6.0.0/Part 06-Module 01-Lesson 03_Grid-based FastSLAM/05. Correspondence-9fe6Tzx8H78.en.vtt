00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
While studying the nature of the SLAM problem,

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.244
we concluded that SLAM is a continuous discrete estimation problem.

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:12.120
Discrete component of the SLAM problem has to do with correspondence.

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:14.684
And since it's an important aspect,

00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:18.164
we should explicitly includ it in our estimation problem.

00:00:18.164 --> 00:00:21.239
Meaning that the posterior should now include

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:25.814
the correspondence values in both of the online and full SLAM problems.

00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:28.335
When solving the online SLAM problem,

00:00:28.335 --> 00:00:32.414
we will now aim to estimate a posterior over the current pose,

00:00:32.414 --> 00:00:36.189
map, and the current correspondence value, c_t,

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:39.019
giving the measurements and controls up to time,

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.270
t. On the other hand,

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.355
while solving the full SLAM problem,

00:00:43.354 --> 00:00:48.154
we will now aim to estimate a posterior over the entire path,

00:00:48.155 --> 00:00:51.350
map, and all of the correspondence values,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.405
c_1 up to time, t,

00:00:53.405 --> 00:00:56.450
giving all the measurements and controls up to time,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.760
t. Now that we've added

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:04.174
the correspondence values to both the posterior of the online and full SLAM problem,

00:01:04.174 --> 00:01:06.994
our ultimate goal of estimating the map

00:01:06.995 --> 00:01:10.905
and the robot pose or trajectory remains the same.

00:01:10.905 --> 00:01:16.329
The advantage of adding correspondence values to the posterior is to have the robot

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:22.030
better understand where it is located by establishing a relation between objects.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.765
But what about the relation between the online and full SLAM problems?

00:01:25.765 --> 00:01:29.965
Now that we've added the correspondence values, is it still the same?

00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:34.359
The online SLAM problem is now the result of integrating the robot

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:40.069
poses once at a time and summing over each previous correspondence value.
