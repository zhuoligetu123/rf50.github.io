00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.429
So far, you've learned the key features and challenges of the SLAM problem.

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:07.469
Now, you will learn how to overcome

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:11.875
these challenges and solve the online and full SLAM problems.

00:00:11.875 --> 00:00:15.615
But before we dive into any state-of-the-art SLAM algorithm,

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:19.263
let's recap what we have learned from localization.

00:00:19.263 --> 00:00:21.230
While solving the localization problem,

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.804
we use different approaches to estimate a robot's pose inside an environment.

00:00:26.804 --> 00:00:28.949
One of these approaches was

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.589
the particle filter approach implemented in the Monte Carlo localization algorithm.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.054
Each of these particles have the robot pose

00:00:37.054 --> 00:00:40.650
along with the important weight of the particle.

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.320
Using this approach, we were able to accurately estimate any robot's pose.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.480
Now, let's imagine that you modified

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:53.754
the particle filter approach by adding another dimension to each particle.

00:00:53.755 --> 00:00:58.795
The new particle will now hold the robot's pose, as well as the map.

00:00:58.795 --> 00:01:02.420
Would that solve the SLAM problem? Not really.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.640
This approach will fade and that's because the map is

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.034
modeled with many variables resulting in high dimensionality.

00:01:10.034 --> 00:01:13.769
Thus, the particle filter approach to SLAM in

00:01:13.769 --> 00:01:18.000
this current form will scale exponentially and doomed to fail.
