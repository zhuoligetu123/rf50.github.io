00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
Welcome to the mapping and SLAM module where you will learn how

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.110
robots build map of their environment and how they perform SLAM,

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.509
which is Simultaneous Localization and Mapping.

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.394
You've already learned localization. So, you're halfway there.

00:00:12.394 --> 00:00:13.980
And after learning mapping,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.350
we believe that you'll be well-prepared to take on

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.355
a bigger challenge of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping.

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:22.600
Erika will be joining us in this module to go

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.950
into more detail regarding mapping and SLAM.

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:26.419
Hello.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.720
I'm so excited to be joining you.

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:30.329
As you recall, in localization,

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.129
the robot is provided the map of its environment.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.480
The robot also has access to its movement and

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:38.474
sensor data and using the three of these together,

00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:39.750
it must estimate its pose.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.350
But what if map of the environment doesn't exist?

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.401
There are many applications where there isn't a known map,

00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:48.300
either because the area is unexplored or

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:51.638
because the surroundings change often and the map may not be up to date.

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:53.483
In such a case,

00:00:53.482 --> 00:00:55.579
the robot will have to construct a map.

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.449
This leads us to robotic mapping.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.900
Mapping assumes that a robot knows its pose,

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.420
and as usual, has access to its movement and sensor data.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.370
The robot must produce a map of the environment

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.210
using the known trajectory and measurement data.

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:11.879
However, even such a case can be quite uncommon in the real world.

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:16.119
Often, you neither have a map nor know the robot's pose.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.700
This is where SLAM comes in.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.510
With access only to robot's own movement and sensory data,

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.940
the bot must build a map of its environment while

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.549
simultaneously localizing itself relative to the map.

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.349
We never said that building the foundation for autonomous robots is easy.

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:34.849
But we do think that after working through these upcoming lessons,

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:40.000
you will be able to grasp these concepts and apply mapping and SLAM algorithms yourself.
