00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
Solving the path planning problem through discrete planning,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.429
otherwise known as combinatorial planning,

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:08.324
can be broken down into three distinct steps.

00:00:08.324 --> 00:00:12.285
The first is to develop a convenient continuous representation.

00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:17.009
This can be done by representing the problem space as the configuration space.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.350
The configuration space, also known as

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.745
a C Space is an alternate way of representing the problem space.

00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:26.550
The C Space takes into account the geometry of

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.734
the robot and makes it easier to apply discrete search algorithms.

00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:34.380
Next, the configuration space must be discretized

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.700
into a representation that is more easily manipulated by algorithms.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.315
The discretized space is represented by a graph.

00:00:42.314 --> 00:00:45.799
Finally, a search algorithm can be applied to the graph

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:49.504
to find the best path from the start node to the goal node.

00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:52.520
For each of these steps there are a variety of methods that

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.255
can be applied to accomplish the desired outcomes,

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:58.340
each with their own advantages and disadvantages.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.440
The remainder of this lesson we will study these various approaches.
