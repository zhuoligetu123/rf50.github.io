00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.725
Welcome to path planning,

00:00:01.725 --> 00:00:03.254
the final piece of the puzzle,

00:00:03.254 --> 00:00:07.259
as it relates to teaching our robot friends to operate in the real world.

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.539
Just like in localization and slam,

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:12.959
there isn't one correct way to accomplish the task of path planning.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.714
A path planning algorithm takes in as inputs the provided environment geometry,

00:00:17.714 --> 00:00:20.670
the robots geometry, and the robots start and

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.530
goal poses and uses this information to produce a path from start to goal.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.970
The workings of this box is what we'll spend the rest of the lesson examining.

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:31.529
By the end of this lesson,

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.475
you will be able to: recognize different types of path planning algorithms,

00:00:35.475 --> 00:00:38.834
comprehend the inner workings of a collection of algorithms,

00:00:38.834 --> 00:00:42.905
evaluate the suitability of an algorithm for a particular application,

00:00:42.905 --> 00:00:46.475
and be ready to implement one of the algorithms in the lab.

00:00:46.475 --> 00:00:48.530
Well, what are we waiting for?

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.120
Let's get started.
