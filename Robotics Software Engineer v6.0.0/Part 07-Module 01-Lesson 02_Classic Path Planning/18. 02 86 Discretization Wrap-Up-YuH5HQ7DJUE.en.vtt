00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
In this lesson, we are studying Discrete Path Planning,

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.980
which we've broken down into three steps: continuous representation,

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.650
discretization, and graph search.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.179
In continuous representation, we learned how to create a configuration space.

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.460
In our study of discretization,

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.850
we learned about three different types of methods that can be used to

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.405
represent a configuration space with discrete segments.

00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:28.095
The first of these methods is the roadmap group of methods.

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:32.219
Here, we modeled the configuration space as a simple graph by

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.839
either connecting the vertices of the obstacles or building a Voronoi diagram.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.630
Next, we looked at cell decomposition,

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.725
which broke the space into a finite number of cells,

00:00:42.725 --> 00:00:46.715
each of which was assessed to be empty, full, or mixed.

00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:50.240
The empty cells were then linked together to create a graph.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.429
Lastly, gradient field is a method that models the configuration space using

00:00:55.429 --> 00:01:01.130
a 3D function that has the goal as global minimum and obstacles as tall structures.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.480
Now, most of these methods left us with a graph representations of the space.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.275
In the upcoming section on graph search,

00:01:08.275 --> 00:01:13.240
you will learn how to traverse the graph to find the best path for your robot.
