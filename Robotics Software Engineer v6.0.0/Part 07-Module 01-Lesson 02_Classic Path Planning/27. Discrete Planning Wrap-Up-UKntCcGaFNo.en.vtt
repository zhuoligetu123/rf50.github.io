00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
Well, that's all the risks to Discrete Path Planning.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.365
You've learned the three steps that compose the process,

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:10.905
and you've learned different approaches to accomplishing every step.

00:00:10.904 --> 00:00:13.410
With this knowledge, you are now equipped to

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.350
choose the appropriate approach for an application.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.690
For instance, if you were working on

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.320
a two-dimensional robot simulation on a powerful computer,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.170
you may decide to create a configuration space and

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.395
discretize it using approximate cell decomposition.

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:33.000
Then, you'd apply the A* algorithm to search the space for a path.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.835
On the contrary, if you are doing path planning

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:39.840
online on a mobile robot with limited computing power,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.550
you may select a less precise approach in favor of a reduced runtime.

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:46.784
As of many aspects of engineering,

00:00:46.784 --> 00:00:49.229
choose the right tools for the job.

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:52.399
In the next lesson, we will build on what you have learned

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.109
here and study sample-based planning,

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:59.000
to see how it can be applied to more complex path planning problems.
