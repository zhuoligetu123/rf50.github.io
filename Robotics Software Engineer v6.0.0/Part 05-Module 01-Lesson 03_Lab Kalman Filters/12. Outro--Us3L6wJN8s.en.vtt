00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.134
Congratulations. You've successfully completed this lab,

00:00:03.134 --> 00:00:07.544
and estimated the robot pose with an extended Kalman Filter ROS package.

00:00:07.544 --> 00:00:11.625
During this lab, you remapped some publisher and subscriber topics,

00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:15.629
and established the communication between nodes of different packages.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.300
Finally, you grouped all the launch file

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.179
into a single one to be launched from the terminal.

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.329
Overall, this was a good demonstration of how you

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:27.344
can implement a ROS package, and apply it to your robot.

00:00:27.344 --> 00:00:30.660
Soon, you'll be challenged to create your own packages,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.234
and write your own subscriber,

00:00:32.234 --> 00:00:35.689
publisher, service, and client nodes.
