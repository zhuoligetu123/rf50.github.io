00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.827
Up until now, we worked with five different packages,.

00:00:03.827 --> 00:00:06.150
Each with its unique launch file.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.475
We had to open five different terminals,

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:12.224
[inaudible] environment multiple times, and launch each file.

00:00:12.224 --> 00:00:14.535
This is tedious and error prone.

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:18.990
It even gets worse in large projects with more than 20 launch files.

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.899
So, in this quiz, create a Main Package.

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:23.549
Inside the Main Package,

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.000
create a launch directory and store a main launch file.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.295
The main launch file will contain the nodes of all the packages we work with so far.

00:00:32.295 --> 00:00:34.245
After you write the main launch file,

00:00:34.244 --> 00:00:36.349
open a terminal and launch it.
