00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.710
We are still unable to generate the

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.570
filtered and unfiltered trajectories since the robot is static.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.150
Currently, the trajectories are appending zero values.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.890
The robot is performing only a sensor update without any motion update.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.290
Therefore, we'll have to drive the robot in

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.840
the environment as it collects sensory information.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.165
With the turtlebot-telop package,

00:00:21.165 --> 00:00:24.195
we can publish driving commands to the robot.

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:29.320
We'll be able to control the robot with either keyboard or joystick commands.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.725
Now let's have a closer look at the properties of this package and it's nodes.

00:00:33.725 --> 00:00:39.095
The turtlebot-telop node has no subscribers and only publishes control commands.

00:00:39.095 --> 00:00:43.885
Now we need to integrate this package with the turtlebot-gazebo package.

00:00:43.885 --> 00:00:46.580
As you can see, the control topics of

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.585
both nodes in the two packages perfectly match each other.

00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:55.205
Here you can see the final result of integrating the four packages.

00:00:55.205 --> 00:00:56.960
You can drive the robot with

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.790
the turtlebot-telop package and generate filtered and unfiltered trajectories.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.815
Now let's launch the node and drive the robot in the gazebo environment.

00:01:06.815 --> 00:01:12.425
First, clone the package into src folder of your [inaudible] work space,

00:01:12.425 --> 00:01:15.685
then install the dependencies,

00:01:15.685 --> 00:01:18.810
following built the package.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.395
Once again, source the environment.

00:01:22.395 --> 00:01:25.245
Finally, launch the node.

00:01:25.245 --> 00:01:28.580
Inside this terminal, followed the instructions to

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.760
drive your robot and change its speed with the keyboard commands
