00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.705
This program is all about robotics.

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:05.910
Before we jump right into it,

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.910
let's ask the question, what is a robot?

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.880
If you look up the definition of a robot online,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.300
you read that a robot is a machine capable of

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.304
carrying out a complex series of actions automatically,

00:00:19.304 --> 00:00:22.814
especially, one programmable by a computer.

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:26.550
Indeed, a robot is a machine designed by

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.734
humans and can come in many different shapes and sizes.

00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:34.350
It doesn't necessarily need to look like us, humans.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.320
In fact, most robot don't.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.475
A robot's shape depends mainly on its purpose.

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:47.435
For example, a cleaning robot might look like a small remote controlled toy car.

00:00:47.435 --> 00:00:51.125
A flying robot might look like a mini-helicopter,

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:54.125
a mini-winged aircraft or a quad-copter.

00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:55.564
On the other hand,

00:00:55.564 --> 00:00:57.739
a robot that interacts with people,

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.675
often looks like us.

00:00:59.674 --> 00:01:02.659
Whether a robot looks like us or not,

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:05.390
any machine that you refer to as a robot

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.644
should have the three essential ingredients of robotics;

00:01:08.644 --> 00:01:12.769
perception, decision-making, and action.

00:01:12.769 --> 00:01:17.599
These three ingredients are dependent on each other and are connected in a cycle.

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:22.789
A robot uses its sensors to perceive the world around it.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.490
Then, robot analyzes the sensor measurements to make decisions.

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:34.009
Finally, the robot uses its actuators to take actions based on decisions made.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.870
Roboticists often debate if household appliances such

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.780
as a washing machine or a toaster should be referred to as a robot.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.974
What do you think? Is any household appliance a robot?

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:49.655
To answer this question,

00:01:49.655 --> 00:01:52.579
you should identify if your household appliance has

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.209
the three essentially ingredients of robotics that we'll be exploring in this lesson.
