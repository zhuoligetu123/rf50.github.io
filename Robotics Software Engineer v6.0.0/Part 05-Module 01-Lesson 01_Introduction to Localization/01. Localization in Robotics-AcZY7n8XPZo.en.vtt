00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.609
Hey there! It's great to see you again.

00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:04.064
In these coming lessons,

00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:06.030
we're going to be talking about localization.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.290
That's right.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.969
Localization is the challenge of determining your robot's pose in a mapped environment.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.929
We do this by implementing a probabilistic algorithm to filter

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.469
noisy sensor measurements and track the robot's position and orientation.

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:23.835
Here's an example of a robot inside of a mapped environment.

00:00:23.835 --> 00:00:27.240
This robot's job is to keep the house's floors clean.

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.219
However, instead of starting at it's charging dock,

00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:32.549
its starting position was elsewhere in the room.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.500
The robot is moving around,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.774
taking measurements, trying to figure out where it can be positioned in the room.

00:00:38.774 --> 00:00:41.354
Since this is a probabilistic model,

00:00:41.354 --> 00:00:44.714
the robot might have a few guesses as to where it is located.

00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:49.800
However, over time, it should hopefully narrow down on a precise location.

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:53.354
Bingo! Now we've identified the robot's pose.

00:00:53.354 --> 00:00:57.689
Its X and Y position coordinates within the room and theta, its orientation.

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:59.369
Great work!

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:02.114
Now, there's more than one way to localize the robot.

00:01:02.115 --> 00:01:05.572
In fact, there are four very popular localization algorithms.

00:01:05.572 --> 00:01:08.879
Starting with the extended Kalman filter localization,

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:11.280
which is the most common Gaussian filter that

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.325
helps in estimating the state of non-linear models,

00:01:14.325 --> 00:01:16.620
moving through the Markov localization,

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.380
which is a base filter localization algorithm.

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:23.069
Markov maintains a probability distribution over the set

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:27.179
of all possible position and orientation the robot might be located at.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.820
The grid localization is referred to as

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:34.643
histogram filter since it's capable of estimating the robot's pose using grids,

00:01:34.643 --> 00:01:37.498
and finally, Monte Carlo localization,

00:01:37.498 --> 00:01:42.329
also known as particle filter because it estimates the robot's pose using particles.

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.039
In this module, you'll learn the two most common localization algorithms.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.790
The extended Kalman filter localization algorithm,

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.170
often called EKF localization,

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.439
and the Monte Carlo localization algorithm or MCL.

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.567
