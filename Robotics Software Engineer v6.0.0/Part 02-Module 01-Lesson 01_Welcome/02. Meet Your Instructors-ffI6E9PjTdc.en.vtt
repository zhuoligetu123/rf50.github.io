00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.779
Hi. I'm Karim, and I'm happy to welcome you to

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:07.514
the Udacity Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree program.

00:00:07.514 --> 00:00:13.140
Udacity is thrilled to guide your journey through the cutting edge world of robotics.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.630
Let's start by meeting the instructors.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.105
Like I said, my name is Karim and I'll be guiding you through this nanodegree program.

00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:24.149
I am a mechatronics and robotics engineer.

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:29.354
My specialties include kinematics, controls, and electronics.

00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:34.725
I'm really excited to teach you state-of-the-art robotics concepts and algorithms.

00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:36.929
Joining me is Julia,

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:39.039
a mechatronics engineer instructor

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:45.034
whose interests and experience range from user-centered design to combat robotics.

00:00:45.034 --> 00:00:48.064
Hello. I'm delighted to be here.

00:00:48.064 --> 00:00:49.820
I'm very excited to lead you through

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.990
some challenging robotics concepts and have you building your own projects.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.900
Next, I'd like to introduce Erika.

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.125
Erika is roboticist and educator.

00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:04.924
She has successfully competed in two of NASA's Centennial Challenges,

00:01:04.924 --> 00:01:09.219
the Sample Return Robot Challenge and Space Robotics Challenge.

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:10.700
You're going to be learning about

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.094
so many exciting advanced concepts that you'll be applying to real robotics projects,

00:01:15.094 --> 00:01:16.734
and I can't wait to get started.

00:01:16.734 --> 00:01:19.159
All right. You have an awesome journey ahead of

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.689
you and we hope you're excited to get started.
