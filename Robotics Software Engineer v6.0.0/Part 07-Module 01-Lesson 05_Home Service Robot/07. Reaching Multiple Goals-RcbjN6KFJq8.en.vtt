00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.219
Now, I will show you my robot traveling to the two predefined goals.

00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:11.410
I'll open the terminal, and run my script.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.840
You can see my robot traveling to the pickup zone.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.855
Once it reached and orient itself,

00:00:42.854 --> 00:00:44.714
it displays another message.

00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:50.075
Now, the robot will wait for five seconds assuming that it's picking up an object.

00:00:50.075 --> 00:00:52.220
Once wait time is over,

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.129
the robot travels to my desired drop-off zone.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:09.159
Here's my robot reaching a drop-off zone and displaying

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.920
a message assuming that it's dropped the virtual object.
