00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.699
I'll show you how I successfully modified

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.679
the node to publish a cube at the pickup and drop-off zones.

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:14.199
First, I'll open the terminal and launch my script.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.039
You can see my object initially appearing at the pickup zone

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.849
then we will wait five seconds for the object to be picked up.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.070
Now, the object has disappeared meaning,

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.750
that it has been picked up.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.730
We will wait another five seconds for the object to be delivered.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.270
Finally, we can see the marker at

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.660
the drop-off zone meaning that the virtual object has been delivered.
