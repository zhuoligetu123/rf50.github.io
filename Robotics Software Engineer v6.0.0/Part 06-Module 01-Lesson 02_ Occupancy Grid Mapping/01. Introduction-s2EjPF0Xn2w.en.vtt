00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.169
In localization, our goal was to estimate the robot's pose in a known environment.

00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:09.419
We did this by assuming a known map that was previously generated by the robot,

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:12.730
drawn by hand or provided by an architect.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.679
But what if the map is unavailable and the robot has to

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.585
navigate in an undiscovered area like another planet.

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:22.320
So, now our goal has changed from estimating

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.250
a robot's pose in a known map to estimating the map itself.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.039
The problem of generating a map inside of an unknown environment is called mapping.

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.040
In this lesson, you will learn how to map an environment with

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.299
the occupancy grid mapping algorithm. So, stay tuned.
