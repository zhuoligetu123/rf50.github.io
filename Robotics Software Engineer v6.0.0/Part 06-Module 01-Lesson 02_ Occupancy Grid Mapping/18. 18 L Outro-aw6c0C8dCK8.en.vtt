Great job completing this lesson.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.480
So far, you've assumed exact trouble poses and learn how

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.905
a static environment can be mapped with the occupancy grid mapping algorithm.

00:00:10.904 --> 00:00:15.599
This algorithm decompose the world into grid cells and implement

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.399
a binary Bayes filter to estimate the occupancy of each cell individually.

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:23.579
You've also learned how to fuse measurements from

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.929
different sensors using De Morgan's law to build a single map.

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.589
The mapping with null poses problem is a challenging one.

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.259
But unfortunately, by solving this problem,

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:37.304
you are still unable to generate maps in the real world.

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:41.814
That's because both the poses and the map will be unknown to you.

00:00:41.814 --> 00:00:45.349
So, get ready to learn how to map real-world environments

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.320
by solving a much more challenging problem in the upcoming lessons.
