00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
The problem of generating a map under the assumption that the robot poses are

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.780
known and non noisy is referred to as mapping with known poses.

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:12.070
The mapping was known poses problem is represented

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.175
in this graph where x represents the poses,

00:00:15.175 --> 00:00:18.490
z the measurements, and m the map.

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:21.939
The Occupancy Grid Mapping Algorithm can estimate

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.155
the posterior map giving noisy measurements and known poses.

00:00:26.155 --> 00:00:28.420
In most robotic applications,

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.575
odometry data is noisy and robot poses are unknown to us,

00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:37.930
so you might be wondering why mapping is necessary under such a situation.

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:41.429
Well, mapping usually happens after SLAM,

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:45.575
thus, the power of mapping is in its post-processing.

00:00:45.575 --> 00:00:52.230
In SLAM, the problem changes from mapping with known poses to mapping with unknown poses.

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.019
During SLAM, the robot built in map of

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.815
the environment are localize itself relative to it.

00:00:58.814 --> 00:01:02.655
After SLAM, the occupancy grid mapping algorithm

00:01:02.655 --> 00:01:06.881
uses the exact robot poses filtered from SLAM.

00:01:06.881 --> 00:01:11.219
Then with the known poses from SLAM and noisy measurements,

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:16.519
the mapping algorithm generate a map fit for path planning and navigation.
