00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.588
To estimate the posterior map,

00:00:02.588 --> 00:00:05.160
the occupancy grid will uniformly partition

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.015
the two-dimensional space in a finite number of grid cells.

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:11.400
Each of these grid cells will hold

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.630
the miner random value that corresponds to the location it covers.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.928
Based on the measurements data,

00:00:17.928 --> 00:00:21.960
this grid space will be filled with zeros and ones.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.163
If the laser range finder sensor detects an obstacle,

00:00:25.163 --> 00:00:29.100
the cell will be considered as occupied and its value will be one.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.675
And for free spaces,

00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:35.039
the cell will be considered as unoccupied and its value will be zero.

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:39.704
Now, to find out the number of maps that can be generated out of grid cells,

00:00:39.704 --> 00:00:43.469
let's pick the first two cells and work out their combinations.

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.250
The first combination is a map with two free spaces.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.939
Proceeding, the second combination is a map with

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:55.140
one free space on the left side and one obstacle on the right side.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.899
Next, by flipping the second map,

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.554
we get the third combination.

00:01:00.554 --> 00:01:04.965
And finally, the fourth combination is a map with two obstacles.

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:08.010
Thus, the total number of maps that can be

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.715
formed out of these two grid cells is equal to four.

00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:15.510
To generalize, the number of maps that can be formed out of

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.950
grid cells is equal to two to the power of number of cells.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.125
Now, imagine if you have a 2D space with tens of thousands of grid cells.

00:01:25.125 --> 00:01:29.200
The number of maps generated will be even larger.
