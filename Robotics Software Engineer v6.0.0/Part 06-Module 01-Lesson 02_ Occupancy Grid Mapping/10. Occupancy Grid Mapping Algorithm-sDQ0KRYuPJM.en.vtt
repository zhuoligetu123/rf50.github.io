00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
The occupancy grid mapping algorithm implements

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.575
a binary base filter to estimate the occupancy value of each cell.

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:12.615
Initially, the algorithm takes the previous occupancy values of the cells,

00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:16.305
the poses, and the measurements as parameters.

00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:20.415
The occupancy grid map now loops through all the grid cells.

00:00:20.415 --> 00:00:22.165
For each of the cells,

00:00:22.165 --> 00:00:27.190
the algorithm tests if the cells are currently being sensed by the range finder sensors.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.400
To better understand this condition,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.485
let's take a look at this example.

00:00:31.485 --> 00:00:35.565
Here, you can see a mobile robot sensing the environment.

00:00:35.565 --> 00:00:41.365
The cells that fall under the measurement cones are highlighted in white and black color.

00:00:41.365 --> 00:00:43.470
While looping through all the cells,

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.870
the algorithm will consider

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.390
those white and black cells as

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.915
sets falling under the perceptual field of the measurements.

00:00:50.915 --> 00:00:54.560
Now, the algorithm will update the cells that fall under

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.540
the measurement cones by computing

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.405
their new belief using the binary base filter algorithm.

00:01:00.405 --> 00:01:03.935
As we've seen earlier in the binary base filter algorithm,

00:01:03.935 --> 00:01:07.040
the new state of the cell is computed by adding

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.460
the previous belief to the inverse sensor model.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.570
The inverse sensor model represents the log odd ratio of

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.085
the probability of the posterior map giving the measurements and the poses,

00:01:19.085 --> 00:01:22.520
and subtracting the initial belief which is

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.965
the initial state of the map in its log odds form.

00:01:25.965 --> 00:01:29.540
For the cells that do not fall under the measurement cone,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.675
their occupancy value remains unchanged.

00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:37.520
Now, the algorithm returns the updated occupancy values of the cells,

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.430
and another cycle of iteration starts.
