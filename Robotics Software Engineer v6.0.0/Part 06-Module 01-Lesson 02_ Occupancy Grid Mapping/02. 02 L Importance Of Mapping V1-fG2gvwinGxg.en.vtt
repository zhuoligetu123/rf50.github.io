00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
You just saw that nothing is required in

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.780
undiscovered areas since the priority map is unavailable.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.794
But what if you just want to deploy a robot in your home?

00:00:09.794 --> 00:00:13.259
Well, you can almost always provide the robot with the map of

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.100
your home and expect it to perform and navigate accurately.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.350
In this example, we'll test if a robot with a priority map will navigate as expected.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.385
Here's an example of a mobile robot with a robotic arm deployed inside the home.

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:32.925
The map of this home is uploaded to the robot which is

00:00:32.924 --> 00:00:36.500
unable to perform instantaneous mapping of the environment.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.009
Now, the robot is being asked to pick up a cup from room A and deliver it to room B.

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:48.545
It has computed its trajectory and starts navigating from room A to room B.

00:00:48.545 --> 00:00:53.380
Currently, the robot is only performing localization.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.175
Great! It has successfully moved from room A to room B,

00:00:58.174 --> 00:01:00.229
and delivered the cup.

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.079
Let's try it again, but this time

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.560
the resident of this house has rearranged the furniture.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.314
As a result, the passage between room A and B is now blocked.

00:01:11.314 --> 00:01:16.549
The robot is once again commanded to deliver an item to room B.

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.474
This time, a plate.

00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:21.579
It picks up the plate, start navigating,

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:26.105
and suddenly hits one of the pieces of furniture and get stopped.

00:01:26.105 --> 00:01:28.055
So, why did this happen,

00:01:28.055 --> 00:01:31.160
and how can we keep this from happening again?

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.604
Well, the robot is unable to adapt to changes and update its own map.

00:01:36.605 --> 00:01:42.245
Mapping is critical in dynamic environments where objects may shift over time.

00:01:42.245 --> 00:01:45.785
If the map has been updated after differentials walls,

00:01:45.784 --> 00:01:49.159
rearrange, the robot would have taken a different passage.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.759
Thus, in changing environments,

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.454
the robot should always perform instantaneous mapping

00:01:54.454 --> 00:01:57.469
in both discovered and undiscovered areas,

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.019
even if the priority map is available.
