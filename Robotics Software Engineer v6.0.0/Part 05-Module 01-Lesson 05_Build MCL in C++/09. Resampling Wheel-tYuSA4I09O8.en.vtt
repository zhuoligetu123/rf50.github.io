00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.555
Let's have a closer look at how particles are being picked.

00:00:03.555 --> 00:00:06.884
In this example, we are giving a set of eight particles,

00:00:06.884 --> 00:00:09.189
each with its specific weight.

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:12.269
These particles are initially grouped in a wheel with

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.434
each particle occupying a space depending on its weight.

00:00:16.434 --> 00:00:18.674
We can notice that particles one and three

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:22.664
occupy a very small space because of their small weights,

00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:28.379
whereas particle four occupies the biggest space because it has the largest weight.

00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:31.799
Initially, randomly pick an index from the set of

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.984
particles ranging from one to N or in our example, one to eight.

00:00:36.984 --> 00:00:40.679
Let's pick the sixth particle as our initial index.

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:45.929
Next, we will initialize a variable called beta and give it an initial value of zero.

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:50.700
Now, we are going to iterate over the set of indexes and for each index,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.210
we will compute a new beta by adding to it any form

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.439
random value ranging from zero to two times the largest weight.

00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:01.274
In this case, two times w4.

00:01:01.274 --> 00:01:05.459
As you can see, the new beta is now equal to the size occupied

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:09.780
by particle six plus half the size occupied by particle seven.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.605
While W index is smaller than beta,

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:17.829
we should subtract the W index from beta and increment the index.

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.399
Here, you can see that the size occupied by

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.675
particle six is smaller than the size of beta.

00:01:23.674 --> 00:01:28.474
So, we subtract w6 from beta and increment our index.

00:01:28.474 --> 00:01:34.290
Beta size is now reduced to only half of the size occupied by particle seven,

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.509
and the index is now incremented,

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.790
and shifted to particle seven.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.720
Now, if beta size becomes smaller than W index size,

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:45.810
we'll have to pick the particle at that index.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.543
Here, you can see that beta is smaller than w7,

00:01:48.543 --> 00:01:52.045
therefore, we'll pick the particle seven.

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:56.310
After that, we iterate and compute the new beta.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.350
Note that sometimes, you will pick

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:02.549
the same particle more than once because of its small value.

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.054
Now that you've learned the Resampling Pseudo Code,

00:02:05.055 --> 00:02:07.000
try to code it with C++.
