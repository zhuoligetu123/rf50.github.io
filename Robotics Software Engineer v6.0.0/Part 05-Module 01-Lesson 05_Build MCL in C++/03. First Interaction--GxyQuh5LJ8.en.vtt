00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.174
Now that you've reviewed the Robot class,

00:00:02.174 --> 00:00:03.910
it's time to interact with it.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:09.269
In this quiz, you learn how to instantiate a robot object from the Robot class.

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.964
This robot will be initialized with random position and orientation.

00:00:13.964 --> 00:00:18.490
Then, you learn how to change the robot initial position and orientation.

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:21.354
You may be curious to know where the robot is located,

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:22.705
so you learn how to print its pause.

00:00:22.704 --> 00:00:28.889
Following, you learn how to rotate the robot and move it forward into 2D map.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.289
Finally, you learn how to print the distances

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.314
from the robot toward each of the eight landmarks.

00:00:34.314 --> 00:00:39.539
Scroll down to the main function in the C++ quiz and go through the instructions.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.299
You'll notice some missing values and statements

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:45.399
where you'll be asked to fill them out to simulate robot motion.
