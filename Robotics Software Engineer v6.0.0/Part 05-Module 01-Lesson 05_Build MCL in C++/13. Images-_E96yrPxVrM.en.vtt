00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.254
Initially 1,000 particles are spread randomly and uniformly into 2D map.

00:00:06.254 --> 00:00:08.310
We can see that the average error is very

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.910
high since particles are distance from the robot.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.132
Then after a few iterations the average error is reduced.

00:00:16.132 --> 00:00:18.179
But we still need to iterate since

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:22.105
the particles are not precisely estimating the robot's pose.

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:25.589
Finally, after many other iterations the average error is

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:29.089
reduced tremendously and particles are now localizing the robot.
