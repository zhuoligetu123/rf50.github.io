00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
Here's the robot class with supporting and global functions.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.564
In the upcoming quizzes,

00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:08.609
you'll instantiate a robot object from this class.

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:12.359
The instantiated robot object will have a random position

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:16.056
and orientation based on a Gaussian distribution.

00:00:16.056 --> 00:00:18.660
Also, the forward, turn,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.679
and sensing noise parameters will initially be set to zero.

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.695
To update the position and orientation of the robot,

00:00:25.695 --> 00:00:28.460
you can use this set function.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.710
To simulate noise, use this set noise function and

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.265
add random noise values to the robot's pose and measurement.

00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:37.410
Now, if you want to measure the distance

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:40.125
between the robot and each of the eight landmarks,

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:42.039
use the sense function.

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:43.770
With this move function,

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.500
you can rotate the robot and move it forward.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.679
Finally, you can request the robot to show you it's

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:54.659
current pose or the distances toward the eight landmarks.

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.754
There are still some other functions that we'll cover later in the lesson.

00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:01.679
Now, go through the robot class and the functions in

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:06.064
the C++ quiz section and try to understand the role of each one of them.

00:01:06.064 --> 00:01:08.859
After reviewing the robot class,

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:12.200
print "I am ready for coding the MCL!" in the main function.
