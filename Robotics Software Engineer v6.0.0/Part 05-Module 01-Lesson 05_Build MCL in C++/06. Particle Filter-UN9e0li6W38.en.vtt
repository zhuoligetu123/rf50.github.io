00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.104
Now, it's time for you to code the particle filter,

00:00:03.104 --> 00:00:06.820
which is the most essential step in the MCL algorithm.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.490
As we saw in the previous lesson,

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.925
the MCL algorithm consists of two main sections.

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:13.980
In this part of the first section,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.635
particles are generated and motion is assigned to each one of them.

00:00:18.635 --> 00:00:22.559
Here, you'll be coding this fraction by generating the particles in

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:25.049
the first programming quiz and simulating

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.605
motion to each one of them in the second programming quiz.

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:31.414
First, you generate the particles.

00:00:31.414 --> 00:00:35.484
Inside the 2D map of size 100 meter by 100 meter,

00:00:35.484 --> 00:00:40.310
you will randomly and uniformly spread 1,000 particles.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.219
To replicate real-world conditions,

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.929
you'd simulate noise and add random Gaussian digits to the particle forward,

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:49.726
turn, and sensing values.

00:00:49.726 --> 00:00:54.414
Remember that each particle represents a guess of where the robot might be.

00:00:54.414 --> 00:00:56.979
Then, you'd simulate motion for each of

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:00.799
these particles by rotating them and moving them forward.
