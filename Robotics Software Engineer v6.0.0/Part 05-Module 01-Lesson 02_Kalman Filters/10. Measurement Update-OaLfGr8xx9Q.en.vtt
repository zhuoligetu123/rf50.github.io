00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.394
Let's begin our Kalman filter implementation with the measurement update.

00:00:04.394 --> 00:00:08.744
Let's take a look at an example back in our one-dimensional robot world.

00:00:08.744 --> 00:00:12.855
It seems that our robot's been roaming around while we've been away learning.

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:18.449
However, I have an inkling that the robot's current position is near the 20-meter mark,

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.280
but I'm not incredibly certain.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.935
So, the prior belief Gaussian has a rather wide probability distribution.

00:00:24.934 --> 00:00:30.564
Next, a robot takes it's first sensory measurement providing us with data to work with.

00:00:30.565 --> 00:00:33.783
The measurement data, Z, is more certain,

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:36.993
so it appears as a narrower Gaussian with a mean of 30.

00:00:36.993 --> 00:00:39.640
Hey, our intuition was close.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.427
Given our prior belief about the robot's state and the measurement that it collected,

00:00:44.427 --> 00:00:48.049
where do you think the robot's new belief will be?
