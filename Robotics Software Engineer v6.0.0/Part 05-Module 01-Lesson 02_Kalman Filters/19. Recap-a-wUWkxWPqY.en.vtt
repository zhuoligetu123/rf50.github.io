00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.719
I'm really proud that you've gone this far because this content is a challenge to learn.

00:00:04.719 --> 00:00:07.189
You've implemented to common filters,

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.865
one for a single dimension,

00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:11.429
and one for a multi-dimensional problem.

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.449
You then learned how to apply the extended common filter to non linear problems,

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.759
and are now ready to tackle the challenge of

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.815
implementing the extended common filter in Ross.

00:00:20.815 --> 00:00:23.130
I hope that you're feeling more confident about

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:26.039
your ability to apply the common filter to Robotics.
