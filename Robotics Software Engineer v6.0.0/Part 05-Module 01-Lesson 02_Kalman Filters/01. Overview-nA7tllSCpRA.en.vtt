00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
Welcome. If you're hoping to learn about Kalman filters,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.890
you've come to the right place.

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:09.109
In this lesson, you'll start off by learning about the background of the Kalman filter,

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:10.472
what problem it solves,

00:00:10.473 --> 00:00:11.695
how it came about,

00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:13.660
and where you're likely to see it used.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.574
You will understand the challenges of localization and recognize the need for a filter.

00:00:18.574 --> 00:00:21.780
We'll then dive into how the common filter algorithm works,

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.700
first through a one dimensional example,

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.839
and then a multi-dimensional example.

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:29.585
You'll have a chance to implement both in C++.

00:00:29.585 --> 00:00:32.840
You will then learn a specific variation of the Kalman filter called

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.440
the extended Kalman filter that extends its reach of applications even.
