00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.234
By implementing the measurement update,

00:00:02.234 --> 00:00:06.230
you've now completed half of the Kalman filter's iterative cycle.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.589
Let's move on to state prediction next.

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:11.640
Recall that state prediction is the estimation that

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.335
takes place after an inevitably uncertain motion.

00:00:15.335 --> 00:00:19.019
Since the measurement update and state prediction are an iterative cycle,

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.780
it makes sense for us to continue where we left off.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.980
After taking into account the measurement,

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.885
the posterior distribution was a Gaussian with a mean of 27.5 and a variance of 2.25.

00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:36.045
However, since we've moved onto the state predictions step in the common filter cycle,

00:00:36.045 --> 00:00:39.990
this Gaussian is now referred to as the prior belief.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.865
This is the robot's best estimate of its current location.

00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:46.829
Next, the robot executes a command.

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.049
Move forward 7.5 meters.

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:53.570
The result of this motion is a Gaussian distribution centered

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.170
around 7.5 meters with a variance of five meters.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.690
Calculating the new estimate is as easy as

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:03.754
adding the mean of the motion to the mean of the prior,

00:01:03.755 --> 00:01:07.049
and similarly, adding the two variances together,

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.524
to produce the posterior Gaussian.

00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:13.460
Now, it's time for you to implement this in C++.

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:16.449
Please add your code to the state prediction function.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.780
And when you're done, run the code on

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.823
an example prior with a mean of 10 and a variance of 4,

00:01:21.823 --> 00:01:25.259
and a motion with a mean of 12 and a variance of 4.
