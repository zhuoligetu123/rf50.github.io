00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.995
Here are the Kalman filter equations that you've seen thus far.

00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:10.246
We'll be using them to take a look at the two extreme cases for our Kalman filter.

00:00:10.246 --> 00:00:13.080
The case where the sensors measurements are perfect,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.384
and the case where the sensor produces completely uncertain data.

00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:19.905
Let's start with a perfect sensor.

00:00:19.905 --> 00:00:23.730
If the sensor that you're measuring with is perfectly accurate,

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.899
then the measurement noise R would be a matrix of zeros.

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:30.390
I will represent it as so.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.115
In such a case,

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:35.850
the equation for S would be simplified to the following.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.920
When you plug the equation for S into the formula for the Kalman gain,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.274
you have the following equation.

00:00:43.274 --> 00:00:45.765
We can rewrite this equation.

00:00:45.765 --> 00:00:49.049
There's a helpful matrix property that allows us to

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:52.379
apply the inverse not to the product of the matrices,

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.600
but to the individual matrices.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.594
However, in the process,

00:00:56.594 --> 00:01:00.524
the order of the matrices and the product reverses.

00:01:00.524 --> 00:01:03.725
The result is the following equation.

00:01:03.725 --> 00:01:09.655
Then we can use another handy matrix property to simplify even further.

00:01:09.655 --> 00:01:12.849
The H transpose and the inverse of

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:17.769
the H transpose are simplified to be the identity function,

00:01:17.769 --> 00:01:21.849
as R P prime and the inverse of P prime.

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:26.349
The result is that the Kalman gain is equal to the inverse of

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:30.280
the measurement function H. This is important,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.879
so let's keep this in mind as we continue.

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:40.534
The next equation in the Kalman filter has us updating the mean using the Kalman gain.

00:01:40.534 --> 00:01:44.340
We haven't yet calculated the measurement residual Y,

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.010
so let's plug in the equation for it.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.365
Now, we can replace K with what we calculated it to be earlier.

00:01:52.364 --> 00:01:56.954
From here, it's as easy as multiplying out the inverse of H

00:01:56.954 --> 00:02:02.039
to every term inside of the brackets and simplifying the result.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:09.450
Once again, we can substitute the inverse of H multiplied by H with the identity matrix.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:16.489
Then, you'll notice that we have X prime and negative X prime in the same equation,

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.355
these sum to zero.

00:02:18.354 --> 00:02:23.694
And the entire equation simplifies to X is equal to the inverse of H

00:02:23.694 --> 00:02:30.189
multiplied by Z. H is the function that maps from the state to the measurement,

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:34.719
so its inverse would map from the measurement to the state.

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:38.889
The new mean is entirely made up from the measurement.

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.079
We've thrown out any information that

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.425
the state prediction provided because it's not needed,

00:02:44.425 --> 00:02:47.125
the measurement is perfect.

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:51.384
The same can be shown for an utterly imperfect measurement,

00:02:51.384 --> 00:02:55.149
one that you know you cannot rely on at all.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.175
In such a case,

00:02:57.175 --> 00:03:00.115
R would be a matrix of infinities.

00:03:00.115 --> 00:03:03.545
The uncertainty is as high as it can be.

00:03:03.544 --> 00:03:06.764
I'll represent it as so again.

00:03:06.764 --> 00:03:13.334
Now, the equation for S contains the product of some matrices plus infinity.

00:03:13.335 --> 00:03:17.145
In such a case, S would equal infinity.

00:03:17.145 --> 00:03:21.450
Once again, we move on to the Kalman gain equation.

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:24.780
Here we can substitute S for infinity.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.129
And now we have the product of some matrices including one that is

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:33.990
the inverse of infinity as an infinity to the power of negative one.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.820
Well, that's zero.

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.530
And anything multiplied by zero is zero itself.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.485
With a negligible sensor,

00:03:41.485 --> 00:03:43.555
the Kalman gain is zero.

00:03:43.555 --> 00:03:48.040
The equation for the new mean would only have one term left,

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:51.129
and so X is equal to X prime.

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:52.840
In such a case,

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.990
the new mean is equal to the state prediction and

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.610
the measurement update is not included at all as it is unreliable.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.245
As you saw here,

00:04:02.245 --> 00:04:07.390
the two extremes for the Kalman filter are a perfect sensor and a negligible sensor.

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:09.024
And these two cases,

00:04:09.025 --> 00:04:11.920
the new state is either exclusively dependent on

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:16.360
the measurement or exclusively reliant on the state prediction.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:22.944
In reality, you will more often find that the Kalman gain is somewhere between the two.

00:04:22.944 --> 00:04:28.029
It is an averaging factor evaluating which of the measurement update or

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:30.625
state prediction should be trusted more

00:04:30.625 --> 00:04:34.240
based on the measurement noise and the process noise.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.329
I hope that working through these two examples has

00:04:37.329 --> 00:04:40.659
demystified the Kalman filter equations just a bit.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.795
Once again, you need not remember these equations,

00:04:43.795 --> 00:04:47.920
they can be referenced from the lesson or textbook as needed.
