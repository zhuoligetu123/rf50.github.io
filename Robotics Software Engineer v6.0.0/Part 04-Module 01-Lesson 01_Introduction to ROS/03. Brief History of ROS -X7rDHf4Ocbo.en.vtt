00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
Development of ROS, began in the mid 2000s as

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.890
projects switch yard in Stanford's Artificial Intelligence laboratory.

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:11.219
In 2007, ROS became a formal entity,

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.290
with support from Willow Garage,

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:14.834
a Silicon Valley startup.

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:18.660
Since 2013, the Open Source Robotics Foundation,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.390
has maintained and developed ROS.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.880
One of the primary motivation for developing ROS

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:27.695
was that researchers were constantly reinventing the wheel.

00:00:27.695 --> 00:00:31.429
Each new robotics project would build its own software to

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:35.630
implement basic functionality like communication and scheduling.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.368
In addition, because different groups were all working on custom solutions,

00:00:40.368 --> 00:00:43.704
it was difficult for them to share code and ideas.

00:00:43.704 --> 00:00:46.445
It was also difficult to compare results.

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:51.994
ROS, aims to facilitate the development process by eliminating these problems.

00:00:51.994 --> 00:00:53.554
So, who uses ROS?

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:56.000
Lots of people and lots of companies.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.600
There are drones, kinematic arms,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.094
wheeled and even bipedal robots,

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:03.369
using ROS every day.
