00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.609
In order to launch the turtle swim package,

00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:08.009
you must first ensure that all of the ROS environment variables have been set correctly.

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.400
Each ROS distribution provides a handy script

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.044
specifically for this purpose called setup.bash.

00:00:15.044 --> 00:00:19.859
The script is in the OPT ROS kinetic directory.

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.684
You can run it with the bash command source.

00:00:23.684 --> 00:00:27.149
Among other things, the environment variables,

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:31.294
Delta bash shell where ROS commands and packages can be found.

00:00:31.295 --> 00:00:35.270
One simple way to determine if the environment variables have been set,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.075
is to use the bash tab completion feature.

00:00:38.075 --> 00:00:41.815
Typing ROS followed by double tapping the tab key,

00:00:41.814 --> 00:00:48.574
gave us an extensive list of all the commands beginning with the characters ROS.

00:00:48.575 --> 00:00:53.955
This list would be much shorter had we not source ros setup.bash.

00:00:53.954 --> 00:00:55.659
Later on in this module,

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:59.389
will become more familiar with some of the commands listed here.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.284
Having to source the ros setup.bash script for each new terminal you open,

00:01:04.284 --> 00:01:06.494
is quickly going to become painful.

00:01:06.495 --> 00:01:08.185
To combat the monogamy,

00:01:08.185 --> 00:01:11.734
we added the command for you in the bashrc file.

00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:17.829
Bashrc is a shell script that automatically runs whenever you start the bash session.

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.765
Since this workspace uses bash as its default shell,

00:01:21.765 --> 00:01:27.590
it starts a new bash session and runs the bashrc file every time you open a new terminal.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.230
That's it for setting up your environment,

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.920
you're now ready to run the turtle swim.
