00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.509
In addition to getting a list of all active nodes,

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:06.464
you will often desire a list of all topics.

00:00:06.464 --> 00:00:12.884
You can obtain the list of topics by using the command, rostopic list.

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:17.100
This will give you a list of all the topics.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.580
We can see that there are some topics associated

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.669
with rosout node that we discussed a moment ago,

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.740
and there are some topics grouped together under a turtle one namespace.

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:30.404
As you may have guessed,

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:35.865
all of the topics grouped under the turtle1 namespace are provided by a turtlesim node,

00:00:35.865 --> 00:00:40.495
and are associated with a turtle we see in the virtual world.

00:00:40.494 --> 00:00:42.659
Publishing a message to

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:48.134
the cmd_vel topic will commend the turtle to move with a given velocity.

00:00:48.134 --> 00:00:52.199
Turtle1 also contains a color sensor,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.935
and a turtlesim node publishes readings from this sensor on the color sensor topic.

00:00:58.935 --> 00:01:02.390
Lastly, the turtlesim node publishes

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.474
the position and orientation of the turtle to the post topic.

00:01:07.474 --> 00:01:11.890
While the topic names here are somewhat indicative of their purpose,

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.849
this won't always be the case.

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:19.309
Sometimes, you will need to get more information about a specific topic.
