00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.355
Welcome to ROS essentials.

00:00:02.355 --> 00:00:07.859
These lessons are all about the Robot Operating System or ROS for short.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.964
ROS is widely used across industry and academia for building robotics applications.

00:00:13.964 --> 00:00:17.750
After this quick introduction to the basic components of ROS,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.574
you'll have the tools you need to start building awesome robotics applications yourself.

00:00:22.574 --> 00:00:25.649
We will be using ROS throughout this program as

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.859
our software framework to control cool robots.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.449
In the lessons to come,

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.695
you will build on what you learned here to create some really exciting projects.

00:00:34.695 --> 00:00:37.679
All right now, let's get started.
