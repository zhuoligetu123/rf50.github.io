How do any related architectures often differ to accomplish these tasks?\n- How do you deal with severely unbalanced data? In what situations might this occur?\n- How do you reduce overfitting in a neural network? What is regularization, and how does it impact overfitting?\n- Say you have collected camera data from a mobile robot in which you would like to denote various objects of multiple classes with bounding boxes.

What about instance segmentation?\n- Say you have collected 3D data from a mobile robot in which you would like to denote various objects of multiple classes with bounding boxes. How would you go about annotating these objects in your dataset?\n- Given a dataset of images or 3D data over time, what do you need to consider in creating training and validation data? How would you create your test set to test a related trained network? \n- Explain the concepts behind Deep Reinforcement Learning, and how you would implement such a technique toward Motion Planning. How would you determine the reward functions to use? Would your implementation generalize well towards new, previously unseen environments?\n- Have you deployed any models you have trained and tested into any production systems, or otherwise used on hardware outside of the same computer you trained the network on, such as an embedded system?

How would you scale the inputs/outputs between train and inference time? What if the drop probability is 75%?\n- Explain why a convolutional neural network typically performs better on image-related tasks that a fully-connected network.\n- **[Code]** Why do vanilla convolutional neural networks (just convolutions followed by pooling layers, out into fully-connected layers) often struggle in determining where in an image an object resides, and how have more recent methods improved in this area?\n- Explain how backpropagation works.\n- **[Code]** Given a dataset of your choosing, code a neural network in a deep learning library of your choice to train a model to do some type of inference over the data.

The goal is in the corner of the map. How do you navigate the robot from its current position to the goal?\n- Explain some of the different techniques used for global planning (such as at a city map level) vs. micro planning (such as planning on how to go from the entrance of a parking lot to a desired space). Show how you could implement techniques from these levels into one end-to-end algorithm to guide a mobile robot from one distant location to another.\n- Explain the concepts behind Deep Reinforcement Learning, and how you would implement such a technique toward Motion Planning. How would you determine the reward functions to use? Would your implementation generalize well towards new, previously unseen environments?\n- How do you would generate a desired trajectory over a fixed time horizon for a robot traveling at high speed? Consider what information you would need in order to determine a reasonable trajectory, as well as any additional constraints you may need to consider.\n- **[Code]** Assume you have data of various robot trajectories around your own, in which you would like to build a model to predict the other robots’ behaviors, making sure that your own expensive robot is not damaged by collisions. Your robot does not have the benefit of GPU acceleration. Choose a classification technique in order to learn to predict behaviors, and explain your choice. Then, code an example of how you would build, train and implement this model.\n- What is the difference between a data-based approach versus a model-based approach for behavior prediction? Explain the advantages and disadvantages of each, as well as you could implement the separate techniques.\n- How can Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) be utilized in Motion Planning? How does the number of belief states in POMDPs relate to the state space of your robot, and how can that impact the performance or usability of this method in real-world applications?\n- **[Code]** Explain the concepts behind a rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT), and implement an example in code.\n- Explain how lattice planning can be used to discretize and simplify the paths through search space. Construct an example of a simple search space to show how this method works.\n- Given a vehicle driving on a highway with other cars around it as well as potential stop lights and pedestrian crossings, and assuming perfect information from sensor data, construct a behavior tree/finite state machine for the vehicle's motion.\n- **[Code]** 1) Explain the D\\* search algorithm (also known as Dynamic A\\*). 2) What is one way to improve upon this algorithm for usage in real-world scenarios?",

Given a 100ms delay, how would you account for this your controller?\n- What is the bicycle model in kinematics? Make a diagram of it. How does this compare to the movement of a four-wheeled vehicle like a car, and why is it often sufficient in many cases to approximate the movement of a more complex vehicle?\n- Describe how you could implement the Ackerman steering model for a four-wheeled robot, including describing the model itself. How does this compare to a steering model in which two of the wheels are turned at the same angle with respect to an axle? Is this model an approximation of ideal steering conditions? \n- What is the differential drive model, and why is it particularly popular for robotics applications? How does this differ from a modern car?\n- What are the primary differences between kinematic and dynamic models of control? In what situations are these types of models most similar, and when do they diverge? Include in your answer any necessary diagrams that may help to illustrate your point.\n- Hans B. Pacejka produced tire models colloquially referred to as the “magic formula” for tire models. Explain the basis of his models, as well as how you would implement one of these in a robotics system. What forces must be considered in utilizing one of his tire models?\n- Explain the concepts of slip angles and slip ratios with regards to tires. How would you account for these within a control model? In what situations would accounting for these be unimportant?\n- **[Code]** How does a linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) differ from PID control? Does it require a given time horizon, and does it require continuous or discrete timesteps? Code an instance of a LQR given your own selection of time horizon and discrete/continuous, assuming you otherwise already have any necessary inputs.\n- Suppose you built a line following robot. You created a line on the ground, put the robot on the line, but the robot oscillates back and forth rapidly once it is on the line. How would you fix this?\n- Explain how model predictive control can be used to optimize control actuations over a given time horizon. What additional information can MPC take into account that PID control typically does not? How do you determine the constraints involved with MPC?\n- **[Code]** In PID Control, if a robot is in between two waypoints of a desired trajectory, how is the cross track error determined? Code a method to calculate this.

What additional items do you need to consider in order to leverage this type of testing (or training) to real-world environments? \n- How would you ensure all necessary information is logged for debugging purposes of your autonomous system?\n- What tests or architectures do you need to implement to ensure that the integration of a module you have added to a system cannot cause a complete failure of the system if it alone fails? \n- What is the difference between an embedded system and a real-time system? \n- What is a real-time operating system and how does it differ from an operating system like Windows? Why are they often necessary for use in robotics applications, such as self-driving cars?\n- What experience do you have with any open source self-driving car platforms, such as Autoware or Apollo? If you’ve helped contribute, explain what you contributed and how you appropriately documented any pull requests or commits. If you’ve utilized them as part of a project, explain how you integrated these platforms with your work.\n- What experience do you have with any open source robotics platforms, such as ROS or Gazebo? If you’ve helped contribute, explain what you contributed and how you appropriately documented any pull requests or commits. If you’ve utilized them as part of a project, explain how you integrated these platforms with your work.\n- What are the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) levels of automation? Pick three vehicles available commercially or in testing and place at least one of their systems into a level, and explain why it falls into that level.\n",
